<div class="chapter">
<div class="sidenote-left">THE PHAGESIA.</div>
<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK VII.</h2>
</div>

<p>1. A<span class="small">ND</span> when the Banquet was now finished, the cynics, thinking that the
festival of the Phagesia was being celebrated, were delighted above all
things, and Cynulcus said,&mdash;While we are supping, O Ulpian, since it is
on words that you are feasting us, I propose to you this question,&mdash;In
what author do you find any mention of the festivals called Phagesia,
and Phagesiposia? And he, hesitating, and bidding the slaves desist
from carrying the dishes round, though it was now evening, said,&mdash;I do
not recollect, you very wise man, so that you may tell us yourself,
in order that you may sup more abundantly and more pleasantly. And he
rejoined,&mdash;If you will promise to thank me when I have told you, I will
tell you. And as he agreed to thank him, he continued;&mdash;Clearchus, the
pupil of Aristotle, but a Solensian by birth, in the first book of his
treatise on Pictures, (for I recollect his very expressions, because I
took a great fancy to them,) speaks as follows:&mdash;"Phagesia&mdash;but some
call the festival Phagesiposia&mdash;but this festival has ceased, as also
has that of the Rhapsodists, which they celebrated about the time of
the Dionysiac festival, in which every one as they passed by sang a
hymn to the god by way of doing him honour." This is what Clearchus
wrote. And if you doubt it, my friend, I, who have got the book, will
not mind lending it to you. And you may learn a good deal from it,
and get a great many questions to ask us out of it. For he relates
that Callias the Athenian composed a Grammatical Tragedy, from which
Euripides in his Medea, and Sophocles in his &OElig;dipus, derived their
choruses and the arrangement of their plot.</p>

<p>2. And when all the guests marvelled at the literary accomplishments of
Cynulcus, Plutarch said,&mdash;In like manner there used to be celebrated
in my own Alexandria a Flagon-bearing festival, which is mentioned
by Eratosthenes in his treatise entitled Arsinoe. And lie speaks as
follows:&mdash;"When Ptolemy was instituting a festival and all kinds of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</span>

sacrifices, and especially those which relate to Bacchus, Arsinoe
asked the man who bore the branches, what day he was celebrating now,
and what festival it was. And when he replied, 'It is called the
Lagynophoria; and the guests lie down on beds and so eat all that they
have brought with them, and every one drinks out of his own flagon
which he has brought from home;' and when he had departed, she, looking
towards us, said, 'It seems a very dirty kind of party; for it is quite
evident that it must be an assembly of a mixed multitude, all putting
down stale food and such as is altogether unseasonable and unbecoming.'
But if the kind of feast had pleased her, then the queen would not have
objected to preparing the very same things herself, as is done at the
festival called Choes. For there every one feasts separately, and the
inviter only supplies the materials for the feast."</p>

<p>3. But one of the Grammarians who were present, looking on the
preparation of the feast, said,&mdash;In the next place, how shall we ever
be able to eat so large a supper? Perhaps we are to go on "during the
night," as that witty writer Aristophanes says in his &AElig;olosicon, where
however his expression is "during the whole night." And, indeed, Homer
uses the preposition <ins title="Greek: dia">διὰ</ins> in the same way, for he says&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">He lay within the cave stretch'd o'er the
sheep (<ins title="Greek: dia mêlôn">διὰ μήλων</ins>);
</p>

<p>where <ins title="Greek: dia mêlôn">διὰ μήλων</ins> means "over
<i>all</i> the sheep," indicating the size of the giant. And Daphnus the
physician answered him; Meals taken late at night, my friend, are more
advantageous for everybody. For the influence of the moon is well
adapted to promote the digestion of food, since the moon has putrefying
properties; and digestion depends upon putrefaction. Accordingly
victims slain at night are more digestible; and wood which is cut down
by moonlight decays more rapidly. And also the greater proportion of
fruits ripen by moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>4. But since there were great many sorts of fish, and those very
different both as to size and beauty, which had been served up and
which were still being constantly served up for the guests, Myrtilus
said,&mdash;Although all the different dishes which we eat, besides the
regular meal, are properly called by one generic name, <ins title="Greek: opson">ὄψον</ins>,
still it is very deservedly that on account of its delicious taste fish
has prevailed over everything else, and has appropriated the name to
itself;

because men are so exceedingly enamoured of this kind of food.

Accordingly we speak of men as <ins title="Greek: opsophagoi">ὀψοφάγοι</ins>, not meaning people who
eat beef (such as Hercules was, who ate beef and green figs mixed
together); nor do we mean by such a term a man who is fond of figs; as
was Plato the philosopher, according to the account given of him by
Phanocritus in his treatise on the Glorious: and he tells us in the
same book that Arcesilas was fond of grapes: but we mean by the term
only those people who haunt the fish-market. And Philip of Macedon was
fond of apples, and so was his son Alexander, as Dorotheus tells us in
the sixth book of his history of the Life and Actions of Alexander.
But Chares of Mitylene relates that Alexander, having found the finest
apples which he had ever seen in the country around Babylon, filled
boats with them, and had a battle of apples from the vessels, so as
to present a most beautiful spectacle. And I am not ignorant that,
properly speaking, whatever is prepared for being eaten by the agency
of fire is called <ins title="Greek: opson">ὄψον</ins>. For indeed the word is either identical with
<ins title="Greek: epson">ἐψὸν</ins>, or else perhaps it is derived from <ins title="Greek: optaô">ὀπτάω</ins>, to roast.</p>

<p>5. Since then there are a great many different kinds of fish which
we eat at different seasons, my most admirable Timocrates, (for, as
Sophocles says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A chorus too of voiceless fish rush'd on,<br />
Making a noise with their quick moving tails.
</div>

<p>The tails not fawning on their mistress, but beating against the dish.
And as Ach&aelig;us says in his Fates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There was a mighty mass of the sea-born herd&mdash;<br />
A spectacle which fill'd the wat'ry waste,<br />
Breaking the silence with their rapid tails;)
</div>

<p>I will now recapitulate to you what the Deipnosophists said about
each: for each of them brought to the discussion of the subject some
contribution of quotation from books; though I will not mention the
names of all who took part in the conversation, they were so numerous.</p>

<p>Amphis says in his Leucas&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Whoever buys some <ins title="Greek: opson">ὄψον</ins> for his supper,<br />
And, when he might get real genuine fish,<br />
Contents himself with radishes, is mad.
</div>

<p>And that you may find it easy to remember what was said, I will
arrange the names in alphabetical order. For as Sophocles, in his Ajax

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</span>

Mastigophorus, called fish <ins title="Greek: elloi">ἐλλοὶ</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He gave him to the <ins title="Greek: elloi ichthyes">ἐλλοὶ ἰχύες</ins> to eat;
</div>

<p>one of the company asked whether any one before Sophocles ever
used this word; to whom Zoilus replied,&mdash;But I, who am not a
person <ins title="Greek: opsophagistatos">ὀψοφαγίστατοϛ</ins> [exceedingly fond of fish], (for that
is a word which Xenophon has used in his Memorabilia, where he writes,
"He is <ins title="Greek: opsophagistatos">ὀψοφαγίστατοϛ</ins> and the greatest fool possible,") am
well aware that the man who wrote the poem Titanomachia [or the Battle
of the Giants], whether he be Eumelus the Corinthian, or Arctinus, or
whatever else his name may chance to have been, in the second book of
his poem speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In it did swim the gold-faced <ins title="Greek: elloi ichthyes">ἐλλοὶ ἐχθύεϛ</ins>,<br />
And sported in the sea's ambrosial depths.
</div>

<p>And Sophocles was very fond of the Epic Cycle, so that he composed even
entire plays in which he has followed the stories told in their fables.</p>

<p>6. Presently when the tunnies called Ami&aelig; were put on the table, some
one said,&mdash;Aristotle speaks of this fish, and says that they have gills
out of sight, and that they have very sharp teeth, and that they belong
to the gregarious and carnivorous class of fishes: and that they have
a gall of equal extent with their whole intestines, and a spleen of
corresponding proportions. It is said also that when they are hooked,
they leap up towards the fisherman, and bite through the line and so
escape. And Archippus mentions them in his play entitled the Fishes,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when you were eating the fat ami&aelig;.
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus in his Sirens says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> In the morning early, at the break of day,</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">We roasted plump anchovies,</span><br />
Cutlets of well-fed pork, and polypi;<br />
<span class="linespace1">And then we drank sweet wine.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Alack! alack! my silly wife detain'd me,</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">Chattering near the monument.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I'm sorry for you. Then, too, there were mullets</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">And large plump ami&aelig;&mdash;</span><br />
A noble pair i' the middle of the table,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And eke a pair of pigeons,</span><br />
A scorpion and a lobster.

<p>And Aristotle, inquiring into the etymology of the name, says that they
were called ami&aelig;, <ins title="para to hama ienai tais paraplêsiais">παρὰ τὸ ἅμα ἰέναι ταῖς παραπλησίαις</ins>
(from their going in shoals with their companions
of the same kind). But Icesius, in his treatise on the Materials of
Food, says that they are full of a wholesome juice, and tender, but
only of moderate excellency as far as their digestible properties go,
and not very nutritious.</p>

<p>7. But Archestratus,&mdash;that writer so curious in all that relates to
cookery,&mdash;in his Gastrology (for that is the title of the book as it
is given by Lycophron, in his treatise on Comedy, just as the work of
Cleostratus of Tenedos is called Astrology), speaks thus of the amia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But towards the end of autumn, when the Pleiad<br />

But if you should desire, Moschus my friend,<br />

<p>8. But this Archestratus was so devoted to luxury, that he travelled
over every country and every sea, with great diligence, wishing, as
it seems to me, to seek out very carefully whatever related to his
stomach; and, as men do who write Itineraries and Books of Voyages, so
he wishes to relate everything with the greatest accuracy, and to tell
where every kind of eatable is to be got in the greatest perfection;
for this is what he professes himself, in the preface to his admirable
Book of Precepts, which he addresses to his companions, Moschus and
Cleander; enjoining them, as the Pythian priestess says, to seek</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A horse from Thessaly, a wife from Sparta,<br />
And men who drink at Arethusa's fount.
</div>

<p>And Chrysippus, a man who was a genuine philosopher, and a thorough
man at all points, says that he was the teacher of Epicurus, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</span>

of all those who follow his rules, in everything which belongs to
pleasure, which is the ruin of everything. For Epicurus says, without
any concealment, but speaking with a loud voice, as it were, "For I
am not able to distinguish what is good if you once take away the
pleasure arising from sweet flavours, and if you also take away
amatory pleasures." For this wise man thinks that even the life of the
intemperate man is an unimpeachable one, if he enjoys an immunity from
fear, and also mirth. On which account also the comic poets, running
down the Epicureans, attack them as mere servants and ministers of
pleasure and intemperance.</p>

<p>9. Plato, in his Joint Deceiver, representing a father as indignant
with his son's tutor, makes him say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> You've taken this my son, and ruin'd him,</span><br />
You scoundrel; you've persuaded him to choose<br />
A mode of life quite foreign to his nature<br />

He drinks i' the morning, which he ne'er was used to do.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Do you blame me, master, that your son</span><br />
Has learnt to live?<br />
<span class="linespace7"><i>A.</i> But do you call that living?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Wise men do call it so. And Epicurus</span><br />
Tells us that pleasure is the only good.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Indeed; I never heard that rule before.</span><br />
Does pleasure come then from no other source?<br />
Is not a virtuous life a pleasure now?<br />
Will you not grant me that?&mdash;Tell me, I pray you,<br />
Did you e'er see a grave philosopher<br />
Drunk, or devoted to these joys you speak of?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Yes; all of them.&mdash;All those who raise their brows,</span><br />
Who walk about the streets for wise men seeking,<br />
As if they had escaped their eyes and hid:<br />
Still when a turbot once is set before them,<br />
Know how to help themselves the daintiest bits.<br />
They seek the head and most substantial parts,<br />
As if they were an argument dissecting,<br />
So that men marvel at their nicety.
</div>

<p>And in his play entitled the Homicide, the same Plato, laughing at one
of those gentle philosophers, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The man who has a chance to pay his court<br />
To a fair woman, and at eve to drink<br />
Two bottles full of richest Lesbian wine,<br />
Must be a wise man; these are real goods.<br />

Tells us are real joys; and if the world<br />

There would not be one wicked man on earth.

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 439]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EPICURES.</div>

<p>And Hegesippus, in his Philetairi, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
That wisest Epicurus, when a man<br />
Once ask'd him what was the most perfect good<br />
Which men should constantly be seeking for,<br />
Said pleasure is that good. Wisest and best<br />
Of mortal men, full truly didst thou speak:<br />
For there is nothing better than a dinner,<br />
And every good consists in every pleasure.
</div>

<p>10. But the Epicureans are not the only men who are addicted to
pleasure; but those philosophers are so too who belong to what are
called the Cyrenaic and the Mnesistratean sects; for these men delight
to live luxuriously, as Posidonius tells us. And Speusippus did
not much differ from them, though he was a pupil and a relation of
Plato's. At all events, Dionysius the tyrant, in his letters to him,
enumerating all the instances of his devotion to pleasure, and also of
his covetousness, and reproaching him with having levied contributions
on numbers of people, attacks him also on account of his love for
Lasthenea, the Arcadian courtesan. And, at the end of all, he says
this&mdash;"Whom do you charge with covetousness, when you yourself omit no
opportunity of amassing base gain? For what is there that you have been
ashamed to do? Are you not now attempting to collect contributions,
after having paid yourself for Hermeas all that he owed?"</p>

<p>11. And about Epicurus, Timon, in the third book of his Silli, speaks
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Seeking at all times to indulge his stomach,<br />
Than which there's no more greedy thing on earth.
</div>

<p>For, on account of his stomach, and of the rest of his sensual
pleasures, the man was always flattering Idomeneus and Metrodorus. And
Metrodorus himself, not at all disguising this admirable principle of
his, says, somewhere or other, "The fact is, Timocrates, my natural
philosopher, that every investigation which is guided by principles of
nature, fixes its ultimate aim entirely on gratifying the stomach." For
Epicurus was the tutor of all these men; who said, shouting it out, as
I may say, "The fountain and root of every good is the pleasure of the
stomach: and all wise rules, and all superfluous rules, are measured
alike by this standard." And in his treatise on the Chief Good, he
speaks nearly as follows: "For I am not able to understand what is
good, if I leave out of consideration the pleasures which arise from
delicately-flavoured food, and if I also leave out the pleasures which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 440]</span>

arise from amatory indulgences; and if I also omit those which arise
from music, and those, too, which are derived from the contemplation
of beauty and the gratification of the eyesight." And, proceeding a
little further, he says, "All that is beautiful is naturally to be
honoured; and so is virtue, and everything of that sort, if it assists
in producing or causing pleasure. But if it does not contribute to that
end, then it may be disregarded.</p>

<p>12. And before Epicurus, Sophocles, the tragic poet, in his Antigone,
had uttered these sentiments respecting pleasure&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For when a man contemns and ceases thus<br />
To seek for pleasure, I do not esteem<br />
That such an one doth live; I only deem him<br />
A breathing corpse:&mdash;he may, indeed, perhaps<br />
Have store of wealth within his joyless house;<br />
He may keep up a kingly pomp and state;<br />
But if these things be not with joy attended,<br />
They are mere smoke and shadow, and contribute,<br />
No, not one jot, to make life enviable.
</div>

<p>And Philet&aelig;rus says, in his Huntress,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For what, I pray you, should a mortal do,<br />
But seek for all appliances and means<br />
To make his life from day to day pass happily?<br />
This should be all our object and our aim,<br />
Reflecting on the chance of human life.<br />
And never let us think about to-morrow,<br />
Whether it will arrive at all or not.<br />
It is a foolish trouble to lay up<br />
Money which may become stale and useless.
</div>

<p>And the same poet says, in his &OElig;nopion,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But every man who lives but sparingly,<br />
Having sufficient means, I call and think<br />
Of all men the most truly miserable.<br />
For when you're dead, you cannot then eat eels;<br />

<p>13. And Apollodorus the Carystian, in his Stirrer-up of Law-suits,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O men, whoe'er you are, why do you now<br />

Sure this is real luxury and life,<br />
But we are slaves to a most clownish fortune.

<p>14. The poets say that that ancient hero, Tantalus, was also greatly
devoted to pleasure. At all events, the author of the book called The
Return of the Atrid&aelig; says "that he, when he had arrived among the gods,
and had begun to live among them, had leave given him by Jupiter to
ask for whatever he wished; and that he, being a man quite insatiable
in the gratification of his appetites, asked that it might be granted
to him to indulge them to their full extent, and to live in the same
manner as the gods. And that Jupiter was indignant at this request,
and, according to his promise, fulfilled his prayer; but still, that he
might not enjoy what he had before him, but be everlastingly tormented,
he hung a stone over his head, on account of which he should be unable
to get at any of the things which he had before him." Some of the
Stoics also were addicted to this kind of pleasure. At all events,
Eratosthenes the Cyrenean, who was a pupil of Ariston the Chian, who
was one of the sect of the Stoics, in his treatise which is entitled
Ariston, represents his master as subsequently being much addicted
to luxury, speaking as follows:

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 442]</span>

"And before now, I have at times discovered him breaking down, as it
were, the partition wall between pleasure and virtue, and appearing on
the side of pleasure." And Apollophanes (and he was an acquaintance of
Ariston), in his Ariston (for he also wrote a book with that title),
shows the way in which his master was addicted to pleasure. And why
need we mention Dionysius of Heraclea? who openly discarded his
covering of virtue, and put on a robe embroidered with flowers, and
assumed the name of The altered Man; and, although he was an old man,
he apostatized from the doctrines of the Stoics, and passed over to the
school of Epicurus; and, in consequence, Timon said of him, not without
some point and felicity&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When it is time to set (<ins title="Greek: dynein">δύνειν</ins>), he now begins<br />

To love, a time to wed, a time to cease.
</div>

<p>15. Apollodorus the Athenian, in the third book of his treatise on a
Modest and Prudent Man, which is addressed to those whom he calls Male
Buffoons, having first used the expression, "more libidinous than the
very Inventors themselves (<ins title="Greek: alphêstai">ἄλφησται</ins>)," says, there are some
fish called <ins title="Greek: alphêstai">ἄλφησται</ins>, being all of a tawny colour, though
they have a purple hue in some parts. And they say that they are
usually caught in couples, and that one is always found following at
the tail of the other; and therefore, from the fact of one following
close on the tail of the other, some of the ancients call men who are
intemperate and libidinous by the same name. But Aristotle, in his
work on Animals, says that this fish, which he calls alphesticus, has
but a single spine, and is of a tawny colour. And Numenius of Heraclea
mentions it, in his treatise on Fishing, speaking as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The fish that lives in seaweed, the alphestes,<br />
The scorpion also with its rosy meat.
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, in his Marriage of Hebe, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Mussels, alphest&aelig;, and the girl-like fish,<br />
The dainty coracinus.
</div>

<p>Mith&aelig;cus also mentions it in his Culinary Art.</p>

<p>16. There is another fish called Anthias, or Callicthys; and this also
is mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Marriage of Hebe:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">

<span class="linespace1">But th' anthias in the winter.</span>

<p>And Ananius speaks as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For spring the chromius is best;<br />
<span class="linespace1">The anthias in winter:</span><br />
But of all fish the daintiest<br />
<span class="linespace1">Is a young shrimp in fig-leaves.</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">Then, too, the fatted ox</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">And at a noon-day feast.</span>
</div>

<p>And I have quoted this piece of Ananius at length, thinking that it
might give some suggestions to the present race of Epicures.</p>

<p>17. But Aristotle, in his treatise on the Habits of Animals,
says&mdash;"They say that wherever the anthias is found, there is
no beast or fish of prey ever seen; and accordingly the collectors of
sponge use him as a guide, and dive boldly wherever he is found, and
call him the sacred fish." And Dorion also mentions him in his book on
Fishes, saying, "Some call the anthias by the name of callicthys, and
also by that of callionymus and ellops." And Icesius, in his treatise
on Materials, says that he is called wolf by some authors, and by
others callionymus: and that he is a fish of very solid meat, and full
of delicious juice, and easy of digestion; but not very good for the
stomach. But Aristotle says that the callicthys is a fish with serrated
teeth, carnivorous and gregarious. And Epicharmus, in his Muses,
enumerates the ellops among the fishes, but passes over the callicthys
or callionymus in silence as being identical with it; and of the ellops
he speaks thus,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the high-priced ellops.
</div>

<p>And the same poet says, subsequently&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He was the fish of which great Jupiter<br />
Once bought a pair for money, and enjoin'd<br />
His slaves to give him one, and Juno t'other.
</div>

<p>But Dorion, in his treatise on Fish, says that the anthias and the
callicthys are different fish; and also that the callionymus is not the
same as the ellops.</p>

<p>18. But what is the fish which is called the Sacred fish? The author
of the Telchinian History, whether it was Epimenides the Cretan, or
Teleclides, or any one else, says,&mdash;"What are called the sacred fish,
are dolphins and pompili." But the pompilus is a very amorous animal;
as being sprung himself, at the same time with Venus, from heavenly
blood. And Nicander, in the second book of his &OElig;taica, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The pompilus, who points the safest road<br />
To anxious mariners who burn with love,<br />
And without speaking warns them against danger.
</div>

<p>And Alexander the &AElig;tolian, in his Crica, if indeed it is a genuine
poem, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Still did the pompilus direct the helm,<br />
Swimming behind, and guide it down the gulf,<br />
The minister of the gods, the sacred pompilus.
</div>

<p>And Pancrates the Arcadian, in his work entitled "Works of the Sea,"
having first said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The pompilus, whom all seafaring men<br />
Do call the sacred fish;
</div>

<p>proceeds to say, "that the pompilus is not held in great esteem by
Neptune only, but also by those gods who occupy Samothrace. At all
events that some old fisherman once threatened to punish this fish,
when the golden age still flourished among men; and his name was
Epopeus, and he belonged to the island of Icarus. He therefore was one
day fishing with his son, and they had no luck in their fishing, and
caught nothing but pompili, and so did not abstain from eating them,
but he and his son ate every one of them, and not long afterwards
they suffered for their impiety; for a whale attacked the ship, and
ate up Epopeus in the sight of his son." And Pancrates states, "that
the pompilus is an enemy to the dolphin; and even the dolphin does
not escape with impunity when he has eaten a pompilus, for he becomes
unable to exert himself and tremulous when he has eaten
him; and so he gets cast on shore, and is eaten himself by the gulls
and cormorants; and he is sometimes, when in this state, caught by men
who give themselves up to hunting such large fish. And Timachides the
Rhodian mentions the pompili in the ninth book of his Banquet, and
says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 445]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
The tench o' the sea, and then the pompili,<br />
The holiest of fish.
</div>

<p>And Erinna, or whoever it was who composed the poem which is attributed
to her, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O pompilus, thou fish who dost bestow<br />
A prosp'rous voyage on the hardy sailor,<br />
Conduct (<ins title="Greek: pompeusais">πομπεύσαιϛ</ins>) my dear companion safely home.
</div>

<p>19. And Apollonius the Rhodian or Naucratian, in his History of the
foundation of Naucratis, says, "Pompilus was originally a man; and he
was changed into a fish, on account of some love affair of Apollo's.
For the river Imbrasus flows by the city of the Samians,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And join'd to him, the fairest of the nymphs,<br />
The young and noble Chesias, bore a daughter,<br />
The lovely maid Ocyrhoe&mdash;her whose beauty<br />
Was the kind Hours' heaven-descended gift.
</div>

<p>They say then that Apollo fell in love with her and endeavoured to
ravish her; and that she having crossed over to Miletus at the time
of some festival of Diana, when the endeavour was about to be made to
carry her off, being afraid of such an attempt being made, and being on
her guard, entreated Pompilus, who was a seafaring man and a friend of
her father, to conduct her safe back again to her own country, saying
this,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O Pompilus, to whose wise breast are known<br />
The rapid depths of the hoarse roaring sea,<br />
Show that your mind doth recollect my sire,<br />
Who was your friend, and save his daughter now.
</div>

<p>And they say that he led her down to the shore, and conducted her
safely across the sea: and that Apollo appeared and carried off the
maiden, and sunk the ship with stones, and metamorphosed Pompilus into
a fish of the same name, and that he made</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The Pompilus an everlasting slave<br />
Of ships that swiftly pass along the sea.
</div>

<p>20. But Theocritus the Syracusan, in his poem entitled Berenice, calls

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 446]</span>

the fish which is called leucus the sacred fish, speaking thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And if a mortal seeks the gods with prayer<br />
For a successful hunt, or plenteous gold,<br />
A man who lives by the sea, whose nets he makes<br />
His ploughs to raise his crops; then let him come,<br />
And just at nightfall sacrifice with prayer<br />
To this same goddess the most sacred fish,<br />
Which men call leucus, (loveliest he of fish,)<br />
Then let him bend his nets; and soon he shall<br />
Draw them back from the waters full of prey.
</div>

<p>But Dionysius, who was surnamed the Iambic, in his treatise on
Dialects, writes thus&mdash;"We have heard accordingly an Eretrian
fisherman, and many other fishermen, too, of other countries, call
the pompilus the sacred fish. Now the pompilus is a sea fish, and is
very commonly seen around ships, being something like the tunny called
pelamys. However, some one spoken of by the poet catches this fish;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Sitting upon a high projecting rock<br />
He caught the sacred fish.
</div>

<p>Unless, indeed, there be any other kind which is likewise called the
sacred fish. But Callimachus in his Galatea calls the chrysophrys the
sacred fish, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Or shall I rather say the gold-brow'd fish,<br />
That sacred fish, or perch, or all the rest<br />
Which swim beneath the vast unfathom'd sea.
</div>

<p>But in his Epigrams the same poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sacred sacred hyca.
</div>

<p>But some understand by the term sacred fish, one let go and dedicated
to the god, just as people give the same name to a consecrated ox. But
others consider that sacred is here only equivalent to great, as Homer
speaks of</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sacred might of Alcinous.
</div>

<p>And some think that it is only called ἰ<ins title="Greek: hieros">ερὸϛ</ins>
as <ins title="Greek: hiemenos pros ton rhoun">ἱέμενοϛ πρὸϛ τὸν ῥοῦν</ins> (going down stream)."</p>

<p>21. But Clitarchus, in the seventh book of his treatise on Dialects,
says&mdash;"The nautical people call the pompilus the sacred fish, because
it conducts ships out of the open sea into harbour, on which account it
is called <ins title="Greek: pompilos">πόμπιλοϛ</ins> from <ins title="Greek: pempô">πέμπω</ins>, being the same fish as
the chrysophrys." And Eratosthenes in his Mercury says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>Now after all this discussion of ours about fish, the excellent Ulpian
may ask why Archestratus, speaking in those excellent suggestions of
his of the cured fish on the Bosphorus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Those which do come from the Bosphoric seas<br />
Are whitest; only let there be no sample<br />
Of the hard meat o' the fish which grow around<br />
The Lake M&aelig;otis; not in verse can I<br />
That fish correctly name.
</div>

<p>What is the fish, which he says it is not proper to mention in poetry?</p>

<p>22. Anchovies must be next considered. And, indeed, Aristonymus uses
the word in the singular number, in his Shivering Sun&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
So that there really is not one anchovy.
</div>

<p>But of the anchovies there are many kinds, and the one which is called

aphritis<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

is not produced from roe, as Aristotle says, but from a
foam which floats upon the surface of the water, and which collects
in quantities when there have been heavy rains. There is also another
kind called cobitis, and that is produced from some little worthless
gudgeons which are generated in the sand; and from this anchovy itself
another kind is produced, which is called the encrasicholus. There is
also another anchovy which is the offspring of the sprat; and another
which comes from the membras; and another still which comes from the
small cestris, which is engendered in the sand and slime. But of all
these kinds the aphritis is the best. But Dorion, in his treatise on
Fishes, speaks of a fish called the cobites, as good boiled, and also
of the spawn of the atherina; and atherina is the name of a fish; and
some also call the triglitis an anchovy. But Epicharmus, in his Hebe's
Marriage, enumerates the anchovies among the shrimps or membrades;
making a distinction between this and what is called the seed. And
Icesius says, "Of the anchovy, there is one sort which is white and
very thin and frothy, which some people also call the cobitis. And
there is another which is not so clean as that, and which is larger;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 448]</span>

but the clean and thin one is the better of the two." And Archestratus
the contriver of delicate dishes, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Use all anchovies for manure, except<br />
The Attic fish; I mean that useful seed<br />
Which the Ionians do call the foam;<br />
And take it fresh; just caught within the bays,<br />
The sacred bays of beautiful Phalerum.<br />
Good is it too, when by the sea-girt isle<br />
Of Rhodes you eat it, if it's not imported.<br />
And if you wish to taste it in perfection,<br />
Boil nettles with it&mdash;nettles whose green leaves<br />
On both sides crown the stem; put these in the dish<br />
Around the fish, then fry them in one pan,<br />
And mix in fragrant herbs well steep'd in oil.
</div>

<p>23. But Clearchus the Peripatetic, in his treatise on Proverbs, speaks
of the anchovy, and says&mdash;"Because they want very little fire for the
frying-pan, Archestratus recommends people to put them into a pan which
is already hot, and to take them off as soon as they hiss. And they
are done, and begin to hiss in a moment, like oil; on which account it
is said, 'Anchovy, look at the fire.'" And Chrysippus the philosopher,
in his treatise on the Things which deserve to be sought for their own
Sakes, says, "The anchovy which is found in the sea at Athens, men
despise on account of its abundance, and say that it is a poor man's
fish; but in other cities they prize it above everything, even where
it is far inferior to the Attic anchovy. Moreover some people," says
he, "endeavour to rear the Adriatic fowls in this place, which are
much less useful than our own kinds, inasmuch as they are smaller. But
the people in the Adriatic, on the contrary, send for our breed from
hence." Hermippus, too, uses the word <ins title="Greek: aphyê">ἀφύη</ins> in the singular
number, in his Demot&aelig;, where he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You seem not now to move even an anchovy.
</div>

<p>And Callias, in his Cyclops, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">In preference to the best anchovy.
</div>

<p>And Aristonymus, in his Shivering Sun, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
So that there is not really one anchovy.
</div>

<p>But Aristophanes uses the diminutive form, and calls them
<ins title="Greek: aphydia">ἀφύδια</ins> in his Friers, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Nor these little Phaleric <ins title="Greek: aphydia">ἀφύδια</ins>.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 449]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>24. But Lynceus the Samian, in his letter to Diagoras,
praising the Rhodian anchovies, and comparing many of the productions
of Attica to those of Rhodes, says&mdash;"We may compare to the anchovies
of Phalerum those which are called the &AElig;niatides, and you may compare
the ellops and the orphus with the glauciscus; and with the Eleusinian
plaice and turbot, and whatever other fish there may be among them
enjoying a reputation higher than that of Cecrops, Rhodes has the fox
fish to compare." But the author of the Delight of Life, exhorts the
man who is unable to purchase enough to satisfy his appetite, to get
fish to eat by robbery, rather than go without it. But Lynceus calls
Archestratus an epicure, who in that much celebrated poem of his speaks
thus of the shark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Are you at Rhodes? e'en if about to die,<br />
Still, if a man would sell you a fox shark,<br />
The fish the Syracusans call the dog,<br />
Seize on it eagerly; at least, if fat:<br />
And then compose yourself to meet your fate<br />
With brow serene and mind well satisfied.
</div>

<p>25. The acharnus is mentioned by Callias in his Cyclops&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A harp-fish roast, besides a ray,<br />
<span class="linespace1">The head too of a tunny,</span><br />
And eel, some crabs, and this acharnus,<br />
<span class="linespace1">The great &AElig;nean dainty.</span>
</div>

<p>26. The ray, roach, or sea-frog may also be mentioned. They are
mentioned under the two former names by Aristotle in his treatise on
Animals, where he classes them under the head of cartilaginous fish.
And Eupolis, in his Flatterers, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
At Callias's house there is much pleasure,<br />
For he has crabs for dinner, rays besides,<br />
And hares, and women with light twinkling feet.
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus says, in his Marriage of Hebe&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And there were rays and sea-frogs, sawfish, sharks,<br />
Camit&aelig;, roach, and lobsters with hard shells.
</div>

<p>And in his Megarian Woman he writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace6">Its sides were like a ray,</span><br />
Its back was altogether like a roach,<br />
Its head was long, far more like a stag's,<br />
Its flanks were like a scorpion's, son of the sea.
</div>

<p>And Sannyrion says, in his Laughter&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O rays, O dainty grayling.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</span>

Animals, says that the following are cartilaginous fish; the ray, the
turtle, the sea-cow, the lamprey, the sea-eagle, the sea-frog, and the
whole of the shark tribe. But Sophron in his Farces, gives one fish
the name of botis, saying, "The cestres eat the botis," though it is
possible that he may be speaking of some herb. But with respect to the
sea frog, the wise Archestratus gives us the following advice in his
Apophthegms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Whenever you behold a frog, why roast him<br />

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*<br />

And . . . . prepare his stomach.
</div>

<p>And concerning the ray, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A boiled ray is good about mid-winter.<br />
Eat it with cheese and assaf&oelig;tida;<br />
But all the sons o' the sea whose flesh is lean<br />
Should, as a rule, be dress'd in such a fashion;<br />
And thus I recommend you now again.
</div>

<p>And Ephippus the comic poet, in his play called Philyra, (now Philyra
is the name of a courtesan), says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Shall I first cut a ray in slender slices</span><br />
And boil it? aye? or like the cooks in Sicily<br />
Shall I prefer to roast it?<br />
<span class="linespace10"><i>B.</i> Copy Sicily.</span>
</div>

<p>27. There are also fish called boaxes. Aristotle, in his treatise
entitled Concerning Animals or Fish, says, "The following animals are
marked on the back; the boax and others&mdash;the following are marked
transversely, the kind of tunny-fish called colias." And Epicharmus in
his Marriage of Hebe, speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And in addition to all these the boax,<br />
The smarides, anchovies, crabs and lobsters.
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, calls them boeces, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The white synodons, the boeces, and trinchi.
</div>

<p>But Speusippus and the rest of the Attic writers call them boaces.
Aristophanes in his play called The Women who occupy Tents, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But having had a bellyful of boaces,<br />
I turn'd my steps towards home.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">Fish.</div>

<p>And they derived their name from the noise (<ins title="Greek:
boê"> βοὴ</ins>) which they make, on which account it used to be
said that the fish was sacred to Mercury, as the harp-fish was to
Apollo. But Pherecrates in his Ant-Men, saying&mdash;"They say that
there is no other fish whatever, which has any voice at all;" adds
afterwards,&mdash;"By Castor and Pollux, there is at least no other
fish except the boax." And Aristophanes the Byzantian says&mdash;"That
we are wrong to call the fish boax, when we ought to call it boops,
since, though it is but a little fish, it has very large eyes, so
that it might be called boops, having bulls' eyes." But we may
reply to him, If we are wrong in naming him as we do, why do we say
coracinus, not corocinus? For he derives his name from moving the
pupils of his eyes (<ins title="Greek: apo tou tas koras kinein">ἀπὸ
τοῦ κόρας κινεῖν</ins>). And so too, why do we not call the fish <ins
title="Greek: seiouros">σείουρος</ins> instead of <ins title="Greek:
silouros">σίλουρος</ins>? for he has his name from continually shaking
his tail (<ins title="Greek: apo tou seiein tên ouran">ἀπὸ τοῦ σείειν
τὴν οὐράν</ins>)?</p>

<p>28. With respect to the small kind of anchovy called membras,
Phrynicus, in his Tragedians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O golden-headed membrades, sons of the sea.
</div>

<p>But Epicharmus in his Hebe's Wedding, calls them bambradones, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Bambradones and sea-thrushes, and hares,<br />
And furious dragons.
</div>

<p>And Sophron in his Manly Qualities, says&mdash;"The bambradon, and the
needle fish." And Numenius says, in his Treatise on Fishing,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Or a small sprat, or it may be a bembras,<br />
Kept in a well; you recollect these baits.
</div>

<p>And Dorion in his book on Fishes, says&mdash;"Having taken off the head of
a bembras, if it be one of a tolerable size, and having washed it with
water, and a small quantity of salt, then boil it in the same manner
as you do a mullet; and the bembras is the only kind of anchovy from
which is derived the condiment called bembraphya; which is mentioned by
Aristonymus in the Sun Shivering&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The carcinobates of Sicily<br />
Resembles the bembraphya.
</div>

<p>Still the Attic writers often call them bembrades. Aristomenes says in
his Jugglers&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Bringing some bembrades purchased for an obol.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</span></p>

<p>And Aristonymus in his Sun Shivering, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The large anchovy plainly is not now,<br />
Nor e'en the bembras, quite unfortunate.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes says in his Old Age&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Fed on the hoary bembrades.
</div>

<p>And Plato in his Old Men, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O Hercules, do just survey these bembrades.
</div>

<p>But in the Goats of Eupolis we may find the word written also with a
<ins title="Greek: m">μ</ins> (not <ins title="Greek: bembras">βεμβρὰς</ins> but <ins title="Greek: membras">μεμβρὰς</ins>). And Antiphanes
says, in his Cn&oelig;sthis;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They do proclaim within the fish-market<br />
The most absurd of proclamations,<br />
For just now one did shout with all his voice<br />
That he had got some bembrades sweet as honey;<br />
But if this be the case, then what should hinder<br />
The honey-sellers crying out and saying,<br />
That they have honey stinking like a bembras?
</div>

<p>And Alexis in his Woman leading the Chorus, writes the word with a
<ins title="Greek: m">μ</ins>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Who to the young folks making merry, then<br />
Put forth but lately pulse and membrades,<br />
And well-press'd grapes to eat.
</div>

<p>And in his Protochorus he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No poorer meal, by Bacchus now I swear,<br />
Have I e'er tasted since I first became<br />
A parasite; I'd rather sup on membrades<br />
With any one who could speak Attic Greek;<br />
It would be better for me.
</div>

<p>29. There is also a fish called the blennus, and it is mentioned by
Sophron, in his play entitled The Fisherman and the Countryman, and
he calls it the fat blennus. It is something like the tench in shape.
But Epicharmus in his Hebe's Wedding speaks of a fish which he calls
baiones, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come now and bring me high-backed mullets,<br />
And the ungrateful baiones.
</div>

<p>And among the Attic writers there is a proverb, "No baion for me; he is
a poor fish."</p>

<p>30. There is also a shell-fish called buglossus. And Archestratus, the
Pythagorean, says, because of his temperate habits,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then we may take a turbot plump, or e'en<br />
A rough buglossus in the summer time,<br />
If one is near the famous Chalcis.
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 453]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
There were buglossi and the harp-fish there.
</div>

<p>But the fish called cynoglossus differs from the buglossus. And of them
too Epicharmus speaks&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were the variegated plotides,<br />
And cynoglossi, and sciathides.
</div>

<p>But the Attic writers call the buglossus the psetta.</p>

<p>31. There are also fish called congers. Icesius says that these are
coarser than the common eels; and that their flesh is less firm and
less nutritious, and that they are very deficient in palatable juice;
but still, that they are good for the stomach. But Nicander, the epic
poet, in the third book of his Treatise on Dialects, says that they are
also called grylli. But Eudoxus, in the sixth book of his Circuit of
the Earth, says that there are numbers of congers caught off Sicyon,
each large enough to be a load for a man; and some of them even big
enough to be a load for a cart. And Philemon, the comic poet, himself
mentioning the extraordinary congers at Sicyon, represents a cook as
priding himself on his skill, and saying in the play entitled the
Soldier,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
32. How great a wish has now come over me<br />
To tell to heaven and earth the way in which<br />
I did prepare that supper. Aye, by Pallas,<br />
How sweet it is when everything goes right!<br />
How tender was my fish! and how I dress'd it!<br />
Not done with cheese, or powder'd o'er with dyes,<br />
But looking as he did in life, though roasted.<br />
So mild and gentle was the fire which I<br />
Did to the fish apply, you'd scarce believe it.<br />
It was as when a hen does seize some food,<br />
And carries it away to eat at leisure:<br />
She runs all round with care; another sees her,<br />
And straightway follows her to take it from her.<br />
So here, the man who first found out the pleasure<br />
Of dainty eating, sprang up high and ran<br />
All round and round, with his dish in his hand.<br />
The rest pursued him&mdash;it was fine to see them:<br />
Some got a little, some got nothing, some<br />
Got all they wanted. Well, as I was saying,<br />
I took some river fish, eaters of mud.<br />
What if I'd had a scare, or blue-back'd fish<br />
From Attic waters, O thou saving Jupiter!<br />
Or boar from Argive woods, or noble conger<br />
From Sicyon's bay, the conger which the god<br />
Of the deep sea doth bear aloft to heaven,<br />
Fit banquet for his brethren. Then no doubt<br />
The guests who ate would all have seem'd like gods;<br />
I should have been immortal, since the dead<br />
By the mere smell of my meat I bring to life again.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 454]</span></p>

<p>33. I swear by Minerva that Menecrates the Syracusan himself would not
have made such a boast as that, he who was nicknamed Jupiter&mdash;a man who
gave himself airs as being, by his skill in medicine, the only person
who could cause man to live. Accordingly he compelled all who came to
be cured by him of what is called the sacred disease, to enter into
a written agreement that if they recovered they would be his slaves.
And they followed him, one wearing the dress of Hercules, and being
called Hercules, (and the man who was so called was Nicostratus, an
Argive, who had been cured of the sacred disease, and he is mentioned
by Ephippus, in his Peltast, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Did not Menecrates call himself a god,<br />
And Nicostratus of Argos a second Hercules?)
</div>

<p>and another followed him in the dress of Mercury, having on a cloak
and bearing a caduceus, and wings besides. As Nicagoras of Zelia did,
who also became afterwards the tyrant of his country, as Baton relates
in the history of the Tyrants at Ephesus. And Hegesander says that
he called Astycreon, who had been cured by him, Apollo. And another
of those who had been cured by him, went about with him to his cost,
wearing the dress of &AElig;sculapius. But Jupiter Menecrates himself, clad
in purple, and having a golden crown upon his head, and holding a
sceptre, and being shod with slippers, went about with his chorus of
gods. And once, writing to Philip the king, he began his letter thus&mdash;</p>

<p>34. "Menecrates Jupiter to Philip greeting.</p>

<p>"You, indeed, are king of Macedonia, but I am king of medicine; and you
are able, when you please, to put men to death, who are in health; but
I am able to save those who are sick, and to cause those who are in
good health, if they only follow my advice, to live to old age without
being attacked by disease. Therefore the Macedonians attend you as
body-guards; but all who wish to live attend me; for I, Jupiter, give
them life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 455]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">COOKS.</div>

<p>And so Philip wrote back to him as to a man out of his
senses,&mdash;"Philip wishes Menecrates soundness." And he wrote in
similar style to Archidemus, also the king of the Laced&aelig;monians,
and to every one else to whom he wrote at all; never omitting to give
himself the name of Jupiter. And once Philip invited him and all his
gods to supper, and placed them all on the centre couch, which was
adorned in the loftiest and most holy-looking and beautiful manner.
And he had a table placed before them on which there was an altar and
first-fruits of the different productions of the earth. And whenever
eatables were placed before the other guests, the slaves placed incense
before Menecrates, and poured libations in his honour. And at last, the
new Jupiter, with all his subordinate gods, being laughed at by every
one, ran away and fled from the banquet, as Hegesander relates. And
Alexis also makes mention of Menecrates in his Minos.</p>

<p>35. And Themiso the Cyprian, the friend of Antiochus the king, as
Pythermus the Ephesian relates in the eighth book of his History,
not only used to have his name proclaimed in the public assemblies,
"Themiso, the Macedonian, the Hercules of Antiochus the king;" but all
the people of that country used to sacrifice to him, addressing him
as Hercules Themiso; and he himself would come when any of the nobles
celebrated a sacrifice, and would sit down, having a couch to himself,
and being clad in a lion's skin, and he used also to bear a Scythian
bow, and in his hand he carried a club. Menecrates then himself, though
he was such as we have said, never made such a preposterous boast as
the cook we have been speaking of,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I am immortal, for I bring the dead,<br />
By the mere smell of my meat, to life again.
</div>

<p>36. But the whole tribe of cooks are conceited and arrogant, as
Hegesander says in his Brothers. For he introduces a cook, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> My friend, a great deal has been said already</span><br />
By many men on the art of cookery,<br />
So either tell me something new yourself,<br />
Unknown to former cooks, or spare my ears.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> I'll not fatigue you; know that I alone</span><br />
Of present men have sounded all the depths<br />
Of culinary science and invention;<br />
For I have not been just a short two years<br />
Learning my art with snow-white apron girt,<br />
But all my life I have devoted anxiously<br />
To the investigation of each point<br />
Of moment; I have inquired into all<br />
The different kinds of herbs and vegetables;<br />
I know the habits of the bembrades,<br />
I know the lentils in their various sorts;<br />
In short, this I can say&mdash;Whene'er I am<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 456]</span>

At a funereal feast as minister,<br />
As soon as men come back from the funeral,<br />
Clad in dark garments, I take off the lids<br />
Of all my saucepans, and the weeping guests<br />
I clothe with smiling faces in a moment;<br />
And such a joy runs through each heart and frame<br />
As if they were a marriage feast attending.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> What! serving up lentils and bembrades?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> These are some accidental dishes only;</span><br />
But when I've got my necessary tools,<br />
And once have properly arranged my kitchen,<br />
That which in old time happen'd with the Sirens<br />
You shall again behold repeated now.<br />
For such shall be the savoury smell, that none<br />
Shall bring themselves to pass this narrow passage;<br />
And every one who passes by the door<br />
Shall stand agape, fix'd to the spot, and mute,<br />
Till some one of his friends, who's got a cold<br />
And lost his smell, drags him away by force.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> You're a great artist.</span><br />
<span class="linespace8"><i>B.</i> Do not you then know</span><br />
To whom you speak? I do declare to you<br />
I have known many of the guests, who have,<br />
For my sake, eaten up their whole estates.
</div>

<p>Now, I beg you, tell me, in the name of all the gods at once, in what
respect this man appears to you to differ from the Celedones in Pindar,
who, in the same manner as the Sirens of old, caused those who listened
to them to forget their food through delight, and so to waste away?</p>

<p>37. But Nicomachus, in his Ilithyia, himself also introduces a cook,
who in arrogance and conceit goes far beyond the artists on the stage.
This cook then speaks to the man who has hired him in this way,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> You do display a gentlemanlike taste</span><br />
And kind; but one thing still you have omitted.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> How so?</span><br />
<span class="linespace3"><i>A.</i> You never have inquired it seems</span><br />
How great a man I am. Or had you heard it<br />
From some one else who was acquainted with me,<br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Perhaps you do not know how great the difference</span><br />
Is that exists between one cook and another?<br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> A perfect cook is quite another thing.</span><br />
For there are many admirable arts,<br />
All of which he must master thoroughly<br />
Who would excel in this. He first must have<br />
A smattering of painting; and indeed<br />
Many the sciences are which he must learn<br />
Before he's fit to begin learning cookery,&mdash;<br />
And you should know them ere you talk to me,&mdash;<br />
Astrology, and Medicine, and Geometry.<br />
For by these arts you'll know the qualities<br />
And excellences of the various fish.<br />
You'll learn to guide your dishes by the seasons;<br />
And when this fish is in, and this is out,<br />
For there is great variety in the pleasures<br />
That from the table spring. Sometimes, for instance,<br />
A boax will be better than a tunny.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Perhaps; but what on earth has that to do</span><br />
With your geometry?<br />
<span class="linespace8_5"><i>A.</i> Why this. We say</span><br />
The kitchen is a sphere; this we divide,<br />
And take one portion, as may suit our art,<br />
Borrowing the principles of mensuration.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> I understand; that's quite enough of that.</span><br />
Where does your medical skill display itself?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Know there are meats hard, indigestible,</span><br />
Pregnant with flatulence, causing only torture<br />
To the unhappy eater, and no nourishment.<br />
Yet those who sup at other folks' expense<br />
Are always greedy and not temperate.<br />
For these and similar viands, remedies<br />
Must come from the resources of our art;<br />
And how to marshal everything in order<br />
With wisdom and propriety, we learn<br />
By borrowing from the science of the General.<br />
To count the guests requires arithmetic.<br />
And no one else has all these parts of knowledge<br />
Except myself.<br />
<span class="linespace6"><i>B.</i> Now in your turn, awhile</span><br />
Listen to me.<br />
<span class="linespace5_5"><i>A.</i> Say on.</span><br />

To me nor to yourself: but just keep quiet,<br />
And rest yourself all day for all I care.
</div>
</div>

<p>38. And the cook in the Younger Philemon wishes to be a sort of tutor,
and speaks in this fashion&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There, let things be as they are. Only take care<br />
The fire may not too small be or too slow<br />
To roast the joints. (As a fire like that<br />
Makes meat not roast but sodden.) Nor too fierce.<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 458]</span>

(For that again does burn whate'er it catches,<br />
And yet is far from cooking the meat through.)<br />
It is not every one who has a spoon<br />
And knife about him that we call a cook,<br />
Nor every one who puts his fish in a pan;<br />
There is more wit and reason in the business.
</div>

<p>39. And the cook in Diphilus's Painter tells us also to whom he thinks
it worth his while to hire himself, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I will not use your meat, nor give my aid</span><br />
Unless I'm sure that I shall have all means<br />
Which needful are to make a proper show;<br />
Nor do I e'er go anywhere till first<br />
I know who 'tis who makes the sacrifice,<br />
Or what the cause may be which prompts the banquet,<br />
Or who the guests are who have been invited.<br />
For I have got a regular list at home<br />
Of where I choose to go, and where I don't.<br />
As first, to speak of the commercial class;<br />
Some captain of a ship may make a sacrifice<br />
Just to discharge some vow, made when he lost<br />
His mast, or broke the rudder of his vessel,<br />
Or, having sprung a leak, threw overboard<br />
His cargo. I'll have nought to do with him:<br />
For he does nothing willingly, but only<br />
Just so much as he thinks he cannot help.<br />
And every time a cup is fill'd with wine,<br />
He makes a calculation of the sum<br />
Which he can charge his owners or his passengers,<br />
And thinks that what his guests do eat and drink<br />
Is his own flesh and blood. Another came,<br />
But three days since, from the Byzantine port,<br />
Safe and successful; joyful in a profit<br />
Of ten or twelve per cent; talking of nothing<br />
But freight and interest, spending all his love<br />
On worn-out panders. Soon as he did quit<br />
The ship and set his foot upon the land,<br />
I blew my nose, gave him my hand, and utter'd<br />
Audible thanks to saving Jupiter,<br />
And hasten'd forth to wait on him. For this<br />
Is always my way; and I find it answer.<br />
Again, an amorous youth will feast and squander<br />
His sire's estate; to him I go at call.<br />
But those who feast in shares, and throw together<br />
Into one dish their petty contributions,<br />
Though they may tear their clothes, and cry aloud,<br />
"Come, who will cook us our new-purchased supper?"<br />
I let bawl on. For if you go to them,<br />
First there is language hard and blows to bear;<br />
Secondly, one must slave the livelong night;<br />
And when at last you ask them for your pay,<br />
"First bring the pot," say they. "There was no vinegar<br />
In all that salad." Ask again. "Aye, you<br />
Shall be the first to be well beaten here."<br />
I could recount ten thousand facts like this.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> But where I take now is a rich brothel,</span><br />
Where a rich courtesan with other friends<br />
Desires to celebrate with great abundance<br />
A joyous feast in honour of Adonis,<br />
And where you may enjoy yourself in style.

<div class="sidenote-left">COOKS.</div>

<p>40. And Archedicus, in his Treasure, another philosophical cookling,
speaks in this way&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In the first place the guests invited came<br />
While still the fish lay on the dresser raw.<br />
"Give me some water." "Bring the fish up quick."<br />
Then placing all my pans upon the fire,<br />
I soak'd the ashes well with oil, and raise<br />
A rapid heat. Meantime the fragrant herbs<br />
And pleasant sharpness of the seasonings<br />
Delight my master. Quickly I serve up<br />
Some fish exactly boil'd; retaining all<br />
His juice, and all his unextracted flavour;<br />
A dish which any free-born man must know<br />
How to appreciate rightly. In this manner<br />
At the expense of one small pot of oil<br />
I gain employment at full fifty banquets.
</div>

<p>And Philostephanus, in his Delian, gives a catalogue of the names of
some celebrated cooks in these lines, and those which follow them&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In my opinion you, O D&aelig;dalus,<br />
Surpass all cooks in skill and genius,<br />
Save the Athenian Thimbron, call'd the Top.<br />
So here I've come to beg your services,<br />
Bringing the wages which I know you ask.
</div>

<p>41. And Sotades, not the Maronite poet, who composed Ionian songs, but
the poet of the middle comedy, in the play entitled The Shut-up Women,
(for that was the name which he gave to it,) introduces a cook making
the following speech,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
First I did take some squills, and fried them all;<br />
Then a large shark I cut in slices large,<br />
Roasting the middle parts, and the remainder<br />
I boil'd and stuff'd with half-ripe mulberries.<br />
Then I take two large heads of dainty grayling,<br />
And in a large dish place them, adding simply<br />
Herbs, cummin, salt, some water, and some oil.<br />
Then after this I bought a splendid pike,<br />
To boil in pickle with all sorts of herbs.<br />
Avoiding all such roasts as want a spit,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 460]</span>

I bought too some fine mullet, and young thrushes,<br />
And put them on the coals just as they were,<br />
Adding a little brine and marjoram.<br />
To these I added cuttle-fish and squills.<br />
A fine dish is the squill when carefully cook'd.<br />
But the rich cuttle-fish is eaten plain,<br />
Though I did stuff them all with a rich forced meat<br />
Of almost every kind of herb and flower.<br />
Then there were several dishes of boil'd meats,<br />
And sauce-boats full of oil and vinegar.<br />
Besides all this a conger fine and fat<br />
I bought, and buried in a fragrant pickle;<br />
Likewise some tench, and clinging to the rocks<br />
Some limpets. All their heads I tore away,<br />
And cover'd them with flour and bread crumbs over,<br />
And then prepared them as I dress'd the squills.<br />
There was a widow'd amia too, a noble<br />
And dainty fish. That did I wrap in fig-leaves,<br />
And soak'd it through with oil, and over all<br />
With swaddling clothes of marjoram did I fold it,<br />
And hid it like a torch beneath the ashes.<br />
With it I took anchovies from Phalerum,<br />
And pour'd on them one cruet full of water.<br />
Then shredding herbs quite fine, I add more oil,<br />
More than two cotyl&aelig; in quantity.<br />
What next? That's all. This sir is what I do,<br />
Not learning from recipes or books of cookery.
</div>

<p>42. However, this is enough about cooks. But we must say something
about the conger. For Archestratus, in his Gastronomy, tells us how
every part of it should be treated, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In Sicyon my friend you best can get<br />
A mighty head of conger, fat, and strong,<br />
And large; and also take his entrails whole,<br />
Then boil him a long time, well-soak'd in brine.
</div>

<p>And after this he goes through the whole country of Italy, saying where
the congers are best, describing them like a regular writer of an
Itinerary, and he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There too fine congers may be caught, and they<br />
Are to all other fish as far superior<br />
As a fat tunny is to coracini.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Seven against Thebes, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And all the parts of a fine conger eel<br />
Well hash'd together, overlaid with fat.
</div>

<p>And Archedicus, in his Treasure, introduces a cook speaking of some
fish which he has been buying in the following terms&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 461]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">SHARKS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Then for three drachmas I a grayling bought.<br />
Five more I gave for a large conger's head<br />
And shoulders. (Oh, how hard a thing is life!)<br />
Another drachma for the neck. I swear<br />
By Ph&oelig;bus, if I knew where I could get<br />
Or buy another neck myself, at once<br />
I'd choke the one which now is on my shoulders,<br />
Rather than bring these dishes to this place.<br />
For no one ever had a harder job<br />
To buy so many things at such a price;<br />
And yet if I have bought a thing worth buying<br />
May I be hang'd. They will devour me.<br />
What I now say is what concerns myself.<br />
And then, such wine they spit out on the ground!<br />
Alas! Alas!
</div>

<p>43. There is a kind of shark called <ins title="Greek: galeos">γαλεὸς</ins>, which is eaten.
And Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that the best and
tenderest kind of galei are those called asteri&aelig;. But Aristotle says
that there are many kinds of them&mdash;the thorny, the smooth, the spotted,
the young galeus, the fox shark, and the file shark. But Dorion, in his
Book on Fishes, says that the fox shark has only one fin towards his
tail, but has none along the ridge of his back. But Aristotle, in the
fifth book of his Parts of Animals, says that the centrines is also a
kind of shark, and also the notidanus. But Ep&aelig;netus, in his Cookery
Book, calls the latter the enotideus, and says "that the centrines is
very inferior to him, and that it has a bad smell; and that the one may
be distinguished from the other by the fact of the centrines having a
sort of spur on his first fin, while the rest of the kinds have not got
such a thing." "And he says that these fishes have no fat or suet in
them, because they are cartilaginous."</p>

<p>And the acanthias, or thorny shark, has this peculiarity, that his
heart is five-cornered. And the galeus has three young at most; and it
receives its young into his mouth, and immediately ejects them again;
and the variegated galeus is especially fond of doing this, and so
is the fox shark. But the other kinds do not do so, because of the
roughness of the skins of the young ones.</p>

<p>44. But Archestratus, the man who lived the life of Sardanapalus,
speaking of the galeus as he is found at Rhodes, says that it is the
same fish as that which, among the Romans, is brought on the table
to the music of flutes, and accompanied with crowns, the slaves also
who carry it being crowned, and that it is called by the Romans

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 462]</span>

accipesius. But the accipesius, the same as the acipenser, or sturgeon,
is but a small fish in comparison, and has a longer nose, and is more
triangular than the galeus in his shape. And the very smallest and
cheapest galeus is not sold at a lower price than a thousand Attic
drachm&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
But Appian, the grammarian, in his essay on the Luxury of
Apicius, says that the accipesius is the fish called the ellops by the
Greeks. But Archestratus, speaking of the Rhodian galeus, counselling
his companions in a fatherly sort of way, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Are you at Rhodes? e'en if about to die,<br />
Still, if a man would sell you a fox shark,<br />
The fish the Syracusans call the dog,<br />
Seize on it eagerly; at least, if fat:<br />
And then compose yourself to meet your fate<br />
With brow serene and mind well satisfied.
</div>

<p>Lynceus, the Samian, also quotes these verses in his letter to
Diagoras, and says that the poet is quite right in advising the man who
cannot afford the price for one, to gratify his appetite by robbery
rather than go without it. For he says that Theseus, who I take to
have been some very good-looking man, offered to indulge Tlepolemus in
anything if he would only give him one of these fish. And Timocles, in
his play called The Ring, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Galei and rays, and all the fish besides<br />
Which cooks do dress with sauce and vinegar.
</div>

<p>45. There is also the sea-grayling. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is the variegated scorpion,<br />
The lizard, and the fat sea-grayling too.
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his Treatise on Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The hycca, the callicthys, and the chromis,<br />
The orphus, the sea-grayling too, who haunts<br />
The places where seaweed and moss abound.
</div>

<p>And Archestratus, praising the head of the glaucus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If you're at Megara or at Olynthus,<br />
Dress me a grayling's head. For in the shallows<br />
Around those towns he's taken in perfection.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Shepherd, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
B&oelig;otian eels, and mussels too from Pontus,<br />
Graylings from Megara, from Carystus shrimps,<br />
Eretrian phagri, and the Scyrian crabs.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 463]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>And the same writer, in his Philotis, speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p>46. And Eubulus says, in his Campylion,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There was a beautiful dish of the sea-grayling,<br />

Whole graylings, and large slices of the head.

<p>And in his Philet&aelig;rus, he says&mdash;</p>

<p>And Theolytus, the Methymn&aelig;an, in his Bacchic Odes, says that Glaucus
the deity of the sea became enamoured of Ariadne, when she was carried
off by Bacchus in the island of Dia; and that he, attempting to offer
violence to her, was bound by Bacchus in fetters made of vine-twigs;
but that when he begged for mercy he was released, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is a place, Anthedon is its name,<br />
On the sea-side, against th' Eub&oelig;an isle,<br />
Near to the stream of the still vext Euripus&mdash;<br />
Thence is my race; and Copeus was my sire.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 465]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">GLAUCUS.</div>

<p>And Promathides of Heraclea, in his Half Iambics, traces the
pedigree of Glaucus as being the son of Polybus, the son of Mercury,
and of Eub&oelig;a, the daughter of Larymnus. But Mnaseas, in the third book
of his history of the Affairs of Europe, calls him the son of Anthedon
and Alcyone; and says that he was a sailor and an excellent diver,
and that he was surnamed Pontius; and that having ravished Syme, the
daughter of Ialemus and Dotis, he sailed away to Asia, and colonised a
desert island near Caria, and called that Syme, from the name of his
wife. But Euanthes, the epic poet, in his Hymn to Glaucus, says that
he was the son of Neptune and the nymph Nais; and that he was in love
with Ariadne, in the island of Dia, and was favoured by her after she
had been left there by Theseus. But Aristotle, in his Constitution of
the Delians, says that he settled in Delos with the Nereids, and gave
oracles to all who wished for them. But Possis, the Magnesian, in the
third book of his Amazonis, says that Glaucus was the builder of the
Argo, and that he was her pilot when Jason fought the Etrurians, and
was the only person unwounded in that naval battle; and that by the
will of Jupiter he appeared in the depths of the sea, and so became a
sea deity, but was seen by Jason alone. But Nicanor the Cyren&aelig;an,
in his Changes of Names, says that Melicerta changed his name and
assumed the name of Glaucus.</p>

<p>48. Alexander the &AElig;tolian also mentions him in his poem entitled the
Fisherman, saying that he</p>

<div class="blockindent">
First tasted grass,
</div>

<p>(and then was immersed in the sea and drowned,)</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The herb which in the islands of the blest,<br />
When first the spring doth beam upon the earth,<br />
The untill'd land shows to the genial sun.<br />
And the sun gives it to his weary steeds,<br />
A most refreshing food, raised in the shade.<br />
So that they come in vigour back renew'd<br />
Unto their daily task, and no fatigue<br />
Or pain can stop their course.
</div>

<p>But &AElig;schrion the Samian, in some one of his Iambic poems, says that
Glaucus the sea-deity was in love with Hydna, the daughter of Scyllus,
the diver of Scione. And he makes particular mention of this herb,
namely, that any one who eats of it becomes immortal, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And you found too th' agrostis of the gods,<br />
The sacred plant which ancient Saturn sow'd.
</div>

<p>And Nicander, in the third book of his Europe, says that Glaucus was
beloved by Nereus. And the same Nicander, in the first book of his
history of the Affairs of &AElig;tolia, says that Apollo learnt the art of
divination from Glaucus; and that Glaucus when he was hunting near
Orea, (and that is a lofty mountain in &AElig;tolia,) hunted a hare, which
was knocked up by the length of the chace, and got under a certain
fountain, and when just on the point of dying, rolled itself on the
herbage that was growing around; and, as it recovered its strength by
means of the herbage, Glaucus too perceived the virtues of this herb,
and ate some himself. And becoming a god in consequence, when a storm
came, he, in accordance with the will of Jupiter, threw himself into
the sea. But Hedylus, whether he was a Samian or an Athenian I know
not, says that Glaucus was enamoured of Melicerta, and threw himself
into the sea after him. But Hedyle, the mother of this poet, and
daughter of Moschine of Attica, a poetess who composed Iambics, in her

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 466]</span>

poem which is entitled Scylla, relates that Glaucus being in love with
Scylla came to her cave&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Bearing a gift of love, a mazy shell,<br />
Fresh from the Erythrean rock, and with it too<br />
The offspring, yet unfledged, of Alcyon,<br />
To win th' obdurate maid. He gave in vain.<br />
Even the lone Siren on the neighbouring isle<br />
Pitied the lover's tears. For as it chanced,<br />
He swam towards the shore which she did haunt,<br />
Nigh to th' unquiet caves of &AElig;tna.
</div>

<p>49. There is also a fish called the fuller. Dorion, in his treatise on
Fish, says that the juice which proceeds from the boiling of a fuller
will take out every kind of stain; and Ep&aelig;netus also mentions it in his
Cookery Book.</p>

<p>50. The eel is well known: and Epicharmus mentions sea-eels in his
Muses; but Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, mentioning those which
come from the lake Copais, extols the Copaic eels highly; and they grow
to a great size. At all events, Agatharchides, in the sixth book of
his history of the Affairs of Europe, says that the largest eels from
lake Copais are sacrificed to the gods by the B&oelig;otians, who crown them
like victims, and offer prayers over them, sprinkling them with meal;
and that once, when a foreigner was astonished at the singular kind
of victim and sacrifice, and asked a B&oelig;otian whence it originated,
the B&oelig;otian answered, That he only knew one thing; that it was right
to maintain the customs of one's ancestors, and that it was not right
to make any excuses for them to foreigners. But we need not wonder if
eels are sacrificed as victims, since Antigonus the Carystian, in his
treatise on Language, says that the fishermen celebrate a festival
in honour of Neptune when the tunnies come in season, and they are
successful in their pursuit of them; and that they sacrifice to the god
the first tunny that is caught; and that this sacrificial festival is
called the Thunn&aelig;um.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 467]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EELS.</div>

<p>51. But among the people of Phaselis, even salt-fish are offered
in sacrifice. At all events, Heropythus, in his Annals of the
Colophonians, speaking of the original settlement of Phaselis, says
that "Lacius, having conducted the colony, gave as the price of the
ground to Cylabras, a shepherd who fed sheep there, some salt-fish,
as that was what he asked for. For when Lacius had proposed to him to
take as a price for the soil either barley-cakes, or wheat-cakes, or
salt-fish, Cylabras chose the salt-fish. And, on this account, the
people of Phaselis every year, even to this day, sacrifice salt-fish
to Cylabras." But Philostephanus, in the first book of his treatise on
the Cities of Asia, writes thus:&mdash;"That Lacius the Argive, being
one of the men who had come with Mopsus, whom some say was a Lindian,
and the brother of Antiphemus who colonized Gela, was sent to Phaselis
by Mopsus with some men, in accordance with some directions given by
Manto the mother of Mopsus, when the sterns of their ships came in
collision off the Chelidoni&aelig;, and were much broken, as Lacius
and the vessels with him ran into them in the night, in consequence of
their arriving later. And it is said that he purchased the land where
the city now stands, in obedience to the prophetic directions of Manto,
from a man of the name of Cylabras, giving him some salt-fish for it;
for that was what he had selected from all the ships contained. On
which account, the people of Phaselis sacrifice salt-fish to Cylabras
every year, honouring him as their hero."</p>

<p>52. But concerning eels, Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says
that eels have a better juice in them than any other fish; and in the
quality of being good for the stomach, they are superior to most, for
they are very satisfying and very nutritious: though he classes the
Macedonian eels among the salt-fish. But Aristotle says that eels are
fond of the very purest water; on which account, the people who feed
eels pour clean water over them; for they get choked in muddy water.
For which reason, those who hunt for them make the water muddy, in
order that the eels may be choked; for, having very small gills, their
pores are almost immediately stopped up by any mud or disturbance in
the water: on which account, also, they are often choked during storms,
when the water is disturbed by heavy gales. But they propagate their
species being entwined together, and then they discharge a sort of
viscous fluid from their bodies, which lies in the mud and generates
living creatures. And the people who feed eels say that they feed by
night, but that during the day they remain motionless in the mud; and
they live about eight years at most. But in other places, Aristotle
tells us again, that they are produced without either their progenitors
laying eggs or bringing forth living offspring, and also that they

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 468]</span>

are not generated by any copulation, but that they are propagated by
the putrefaction which takes place in the mud and slime&mdash;as it is said
of those things which are called the entrails of the earth. From which
circumstance, he says that Homer distinguishes between their nature and
that of other fish; and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The eels and fish within the briny deep,<br />
Were startled at the blaze.
</div>

<p>53. But a certain Epicurean,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>

who was one of our party, when an eel was served up, said,&mdash;Here
is the Helen of the feast; I therefore will be the Paris! And, before
any one else could stretch out a hand towards it, he seized hold of it
and split it up, tearing off one side down to the backbone. And the
same man, when presently a hot cheesecake was set before him, and when
all refused it, cried out,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I will attack it were it hot as fire;
</div>

<p>and then, rushing upon it eagerly, and swallowing it, he was carried
out severely scalded. And Cynulcus said,&mdash;The cormorant is carried out
from his battle of the throat!</p>

<p>Moreover, Archestratus thus speaks of the eel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I praise all kinds of eels; but far the best<br />
Is that which fishermen do take in the sea<br />
Opposite to the strait of Rhegium.<br />
Where you, Messenius, who daily put<br />
This food within your mouth, surpass all mortals<br />
In real pleasure. Though none can deny<br />
That great the virtue and the glory is<br />
Of the Strymonian and Copaic eels.<br />
For they are large, and wonderfully fat;<br />
And I do think in short that of all fish<br />
The best in flavour is the noble eel,<br />
Although he cannot propagate his species.
</div>

<p>54. But, as Homer has said,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The eels and fish were startled,
</div>

<p>Archilochus has also said, in a manner not inconsistent with that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And you received full many sightless eels.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 469]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EELS.</div>

<p>But the Athenians, as Tryphon says, form all the cases in the
singular number with the <ins title="Greek: u">υ</ins>, but do not make the cases in
the plural in a similar manner. Accordingly, Aristophanes, in his
Acharnensians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Behold, O boys, the noble eel (<ins title="Greek: enchelyn">ἔγχελυν</ins>);
</div>

<p>and, in his Lemnian Women, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: Enchelyn Boiôtian">Ἔγχελυν Βοιωτίαν</ins>:
</div>

<p>but he uses the nominative case in his Daitaleis&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And smooth too <ins title="Greek: hôsper enchelys">ὥσπερ ἔγχελυς</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Cratinus, in his Pluti, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The tunny, orphus, grayling, eel, and sea-dog.
</div>

<p>But the Attic writers do not form the cases in the plural number as
Homer does. Aristophanes says, in his Knights&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For you have fared like men who're hunting eels (<ins title="Greek: encheleis">ἐγχέλεις</ins>);
</div>

<p>and, in his second edition of the Clouds, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Imitating my images of the eels (<ins title="Greek: encheleôn">ἐγχελέων</ins>);
</div>

<p>and in his Wasps we find the dative case&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I don't delight in rays nor in <ins title="Greek: enchelesin">ἐγχέλεσιν</ins>
</div>

<p>And Strattis, in his Potamii, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A cousin of the eels (<ins title="Greek: encheleôn">ἐγχελέων</ins>).
</div>

<p>Simonides, too, in his Iambics, writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Like an eel (<ins title="Greek: enchelys">ἔγχελυς</ins>) complaining of being slippery.
</div>

<p>He also uses it in the accusative&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A kite was eating a M&aelig;andrian eel (<ins title="Greek: enchelyn">ἔγχελυν</ins>),<br />
But a heron saw him and deprived him of it.
</div>

<p>But Aristotle, in his treatise on Animals, writes the word with an <ins title="Greek: i">ι</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: enchelis">ἔγχελις</ins>. But when Aristophanes, in his Knights,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Your fate resembles that of those who hunt<br />
For mud-fed eels. For when the lake is still<br />
Their labour is in vain. But if they stir<br />
The mud all up and down, they catch much fish.<br />
And so you gain by stirring up the city;
</div>

<p>he shows plainly enough that the eel is caught in the mud,
(<ins title="Greek:ek tês ilyos">ἐκ τῆς ἴλυος</ins>,) and it is from this word <ins title="Greek: ilys">ἴλυς</ins> that the name
<ins title="Greek: enchelys">ἔγχελυς</ins> ends in <ins title="Greek: ys">υς</ins>. The Poet, therefore, wishing to
show that the violent effect of the fire reached even to the bottom of
the river, spoke thus&mdash;The eels and fish were troubled; speaking of the
eels separately and specially, in order to show the very great depth to
which the water was influenced by the fire.</p>

<p>55. But Antiphanes, in his Lycon, jesting on the Egyptians after the
manner of the comic poets, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 470]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
They say in other things the Egyptian race<br />
Is clever also, since they think the eel<br />
On a level with the gods; or I may say<br />
By far more valuable. For, as to the gods,&mdash;<br />
Those we gain over by our prayers alone;<br />
But as for eels, without you spend at least<br />
Twelve drachmas you can scarce get leave to smell them.<br />
So it is altogether a holy beast.
</div>

<p>And Anaxandrides, in his Cities, directing what he says to the
Egyptians, speaks as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I never could myself your comrade be,<br />
For neither do our manners nor our laws<br />
Agree with yours, but they are wholly different.<br />
You do adore an ox; I sacrifice him<br />
To the great Gods of heaven. You do think<br />
An eel the mightiest of deities;<br />
But we do eat him as the best of fish.<br />
You eat no pork; I like it above all things.<br />
You do adore a dog; but I do beat him<br />
If e'er I catch him stealing any meat.<br />
Then our laws enjoin the priests to be<br />
Most perfect men; but yours are mutilated.<br />
If you do see a cat in any grief<br />
You weep; but I first kill him and then skin him.<br />
You have a great opinion of the shrew-mouse;<br />
But I have none at all.
</div>

<p>And Timocles, in his Egyptians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
How can an ibis or a dog be able<br />
To save a man? For where with impious hearts<br />
Men sin against the all-acknowledged Gods,<br />
And yet escape unpunish'd, who can think<br />
The altar of a cat will be more holy,<br />
Or prompter to avenge itself, than they?
</div>

<p>56. But that men used to wrap eels up in beet, and then eat them, is a
fact constantly alluded to in the poets of the old comedy; and Eubulus
says in his Echo&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The nymph who never knew the joys of marriage,<br />
Clothed with rosy beet will now appear,<br />
The white-flesh'd eel. Hail, brilliant luminary,<br />
Great in my taste, and in your own good qualities.
</div>

<p>And in his Ionian he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And after this were served up the rich<br />
Entrails of roasted tunnies; then there came<br />
Those natives of the lake, the holy eels,<br />
B&oelig;otian goddesses; all clothed in beet.
</div>

<p>And in his Medea he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 471]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EELS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
The sweet B&oelig;otian Copaic virgin;<br />
For I do fear to name the Goddess.
</div>

<p>And that the eels of the river Strymon were also celebrated, Antiphanes
tells us in his Thamyras, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then your namesake river, far renown'd<br />
In all the mouths of men, the mighty Strymon,<br />
Who waters the rich warlike plains of Thrace,<br />
Breeds mighty eels.
</div>

<p>And Demetrius the Scepsian, in the sixteenth book of his Trojan Array,
says that there were eels of surpassing excellence produced in the
neighbourhood of the river Euleus (and this river is mentioned by
Antimachus in his work entitled The Tablets, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Arriving at the springs<br />
Where Euleus with his rapid eddies rises).
</div>

<p>57. With respect to the ellops, some mention has already been made of
him. But Archestratus also speaks in this way of him&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The best of ellopes which you can eat<br />
Come from the bay of famous Syracuse.<br />
Those eat whene'er you can. For that's the place<br />
Whence this great fish originally came.<br />
But those which are around the islands caught,<br />
Or any other land, or nigh to Crete,<br />
Too long have battled with the eddying currents,<br />
And so are thin and harder to the taste.
</div>

<p>58. The erythrinus, or red mullet, has been mentioned too. Aristotle,
in his book on Animals, and Speusippus both say that the fishes called
erythrinus, phagrus, and hepatus are all very nearly alike. And Dorion
has said much the same in his treatise on Fish. But the Cyren&aelig;ans give
the name of erythrinus to the hyca; as Clitarchus tells us in his
Dialects.</p>

<p>59. The encrasicholi are also mentioned by Aristotle as fish of small
size, in his treatise on What relates to Animals. But Dorion, in his
book on Fishes, speaks of the encrasicholi among those which are
best boiled, speaking in the following terms&mdash;"One ought to boil the
encrasicholi, and the iopes, and the atherin&aelig;, and the tench, and the
smaller mullets, and the cuttle-fish, and the squid, and the different
kinds of crab or crawfish."</p>

<p>60. The hepsetus, or boiled fish, is a name given to several small
fish. Aristophanes, in his Anagyrus, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 472]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is not one dish of hepseti.
</div>

<p>And Archippus says in his Fishes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
An hepsetus fell in with an anchovy<br />
And quick devour'd him.
</div>

<p>And Eupolis, in his Goats, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Ye graces who do love the hepseti.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus, in his Prosusia or Cycnus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Contented if just once in each twelve days<br />
He sees an hepsetus well boil'd in beet.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Apeglaucomenos, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were some hepseti besides served up<br />
In a d&aelig;dalean manner. For they call<br />
All clever works by the name of D&aelig;dalus;
</div>

<p>and presently afterwards he continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Will you not now then try the coracini?<br />
Nor trichides, nor any hepseti?
</div>

<p>But this word is always used in the plural, <ins title="Greek: hephêtoi">ἑψητοὶ</ins>, because
they are only served up in numbers. Aristophanes, in his Dramata or
Niobus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I will say nothing of a dish of hepseti.
</div>

<p>And Menander, in his Perinthian Woman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The boy came in bringing some hepseti.
</div>

<p>But Nicostratus uses the word in the singular number, in his Hesiod&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A bembras, an anchovy, and a hepsetus.
</div>

<p>And Posidippus, in his Woman shut up, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
She's gone to buy a hepsetus.
</div>

<p>But in my country Naucratis, what they call hepseti are little fish
left in the drains or ditches, when the Nile ceases its overflowing.</p>

<p>61. The hepatus or lebias is the next fish to be noticed. Diocles
affirms that this is one of those fish which stick to the rocks; but
Speusippus says that the hepatus is the same as the phagrus. But it
is a solitary fish, as Aristotle declares, carnivorous, and with
serrated teeth; black as to its flesh, and having eyes large, out of
all proportion to the rest of its size; and its heart is triangular and
white. But Archestratus, the marshal of banquets, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Remember that the lebias is best,<br />
As also is the hepatus, in the waves<br />
Which wash the Delian and the Tenian shores.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 473]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE TUNNY-FISH.</div>

<p>62. Then come the elacatenes, or spindle-fish. Mnesimachus, in his
Horse-breeder, classes together in one line&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The turbot, tunny, tench, elacatene.
</div>

<p>But they are a cetaceous fish, very good for curing. Menander, in his
Colons, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The tench, th' elacatene, and the tail-fin of<br />
The sea-dog are the best for pickling.
</div>

<p>And Mnaseas of Patra says, "Of Ichthys and Hesychia, his sister, were
born the galene, the lamprey, and the elacatene.</p>

<p>63. The tunny must also not be forgotten. Aristotle says this fish
swims into the Black Sea, always keeping the land on the right; but
that he sails out again, keeping the land on the left. For that he can
see much best with his right eye, but that he is rather blind with
his left eye. And under his fins he has a sort of gadfly; he delights
in heat, on which account he comes wherever there is sand; and he
is most eatable at the season when he gets rid of that fly. But he
propagates his species after his time of torpor is over, as we are told
by Theophrastus; and as long as his offspring are little, he is very
difficult to catch, but when they get larger, then he is easily caught,
because of the gadfly. But the tunny lies in holes, although he is a
fish with a great deal of blood. And Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Around the sacred and the spacious isle<br />
Of Samos you may see large tunnies caught.<br />
The Samians call them horcyes, and others<br />
Do name them cetus. These 'tis well to buy,<br />
Fit offering for the Gods; and do it quickly,<br />
Nor stop to haggle or bargain for the price.<br />
Good too are those which fair Byzantium,<br />
Or the Carystian marble rocks do breed.<br />
And in the famous isle of Sicily,<br />
The Cephal&oelig;dian and Tyndarian shores<br />
Send forth fish richer still. And if you come<br />
To sacred Italy, where Hipponium's cape<br />
Frowns on the waves which lave the Bruttian coast,<br />
Those are the best of all. The tunnies there<br />
Have gain'd the height of fame and palm of victory.<br />
Still those which there you find have wander'd far,<br />
Cross'd many seas, and many a roaring strait,<br />
So that we often catch them out of season.
</div>

<p>64. But this fish was called the tunny (<ins title="Greek: thynnos">θύννος</ins>) from rushing
(<ins title="Greek: apo tou thyein">ἀπὸ τοῦ θύειν</ins>), and moving rapidly. For it is an impetuous fish, from, at a
particular season, having a gadfly
in its head; by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 474]</span>

which Aristotle says that it is driven about, writing thus&mdash;"But the
tunny-fish and the sword fish are driven to frenzy about the time of
the rising of the dogstar; for both of them at that season have under
their fins something like a small worm, which is called &oelig;strus,
resembling a scorpion, and in size something similar to a spider, and
this makes them leap about in leaps as large as those of the dolphin."
And Theodoridas says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The tunnies bend their furious course to Gades.
</div>

<p>But Polybius of Megalopolis, in the thirty-fourth book of his History,
speaking of the Lusitanian district in Iberia, says, "That in the sea,
in these parts, acorn-bearing oaks grow, on the fruit of which the
tunnies feed, and grow fat; so that a person who called the tunny the
pig of the sea would not err, for the tunnies, like the pigs, grow to a
great size on these acorns."</p>

<p>65. And the intestines of this fish are highly extolled, as Eubulus
also tells us, in his Ionian,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And after this the luscious intestines<br />
Of roasted tunnies sail'd upon the table.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Lemnian Woman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Despise not thou the fat B&oelig;otian eel,<br />
Nor grayling, nor the entrails of the tunny.
</div>

<p>And Strattis, in his Atalanta, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Next buy the entrails of a tunny, and<br />
Some pettitoes of pigs, to cost a drachma.
</div>

<p>And the same poet says in his Macedonians&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the sweet entrails of the tunny-fish.
</div>

<p>And Eriphus says in his Melib&oelig;a&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
These things poor men cannot afford to buy,<br />
The entrails of the tunny or the head<br />
Of greedy pike, or conger, or cuttle-fish,<br />
Which I don't think the gods above despise.
</div>

<p>But when Theopompus, in his Call&aelig;schrus, says,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The <ins title="Greek: hypogastrion">ὑπογάστριον</ins> of fish, O Ceres,
</div>

<p>we must take notice that the writers of his time apply the term <ins title="Greek: hypogastrion">ὑπογάστριον</ins> to fish, but very seldom to pigs or other animals; but it
is uncertain what animals Antiphanes is speaking of, when he makes use
of the term <ins title="Greek: hypogastrion">ὑπογάστριον</ins> in his Ponticus, where he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 475]</span></p>

</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Ulysses weaving, praises the head of the tunny; and
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> And I will throw the fishers headlong down</span><br />

<span class="linespace8_5"><i>B.</i> But not long ago,</span><br />
This man, if he could get a tunny's head,<br />
Thought he was eating tunnies whole, and eels.
</div>

<p>They praised also that part of the tunny which they called "the key,"
as Aristophon does, in his Peirithus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> But now the dinner is all spoilt entirely.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Here are two roasted keys quite fit to eat.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> What, keys to open doors?</span><br />
<span class="linespace10_5"><i>B.</i> No, tunny keys;</span><br />

<span class="linespace5_5"><i>A.</i> There is the Spartan key too.</span>
</div>

<p>66. But Antigonus the Carystian, in his treatise on Language, says that
the tunny is sacrificed to Neptune, as we have already mentioned. But
Heracleon the Ephesian says that the Attic writers call the tunny the
orcynus. And Sostratus, in the second book of his treatise on Animals,
says that the pelamys is called the thunnis, or female tunny-fish; but
that when it becomes larger, it is called thunnus; and when it gets to
a larger size still, it is called the orcynus; and that when it has
grown to a size which is quite enormous, then it is called cetus. And
&AElig;schylus likewise mentions the tunny, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I bid you take up hammers now, and beat<br />
The fiery mass of iron, which will utter<br />
No groan, but bear in silence like the tunny.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Turning his eye aside, just like the tunny;
</div>

<p>because the tunny cannot see well out of his left eye, as Aristotle has
said. Menander, in his Fishermen, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the disturbed and muddy sea which breeds<br />
The largest tunnies.

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 476]</span></p>

<p>And in Sophron we find the word <ins title="Greek: thynnothêras">θυννοθήρας</ins> (a hunter of
tunnies); but the same fish which is usually called <ins title="Greek: thynnos">θύννος</ins>,
the Attic writers call <ins title="Greek: thynnis">θυννίς</ins>.</p>

<p>67. But as to the thunnis, Aristotle says that this is the female,
differing from the male thunnus in having a fin under the belly, the
name of which fin is the "ather." But in his treatise on the Parts of
Animals, he again distinguishes the thunnis from the thunnus; saying,
that "in the summer, about the month Hecatomb&aelig;on, it drops something
like a bag, in which there are a great number of small eggs." And
Speusippus, in the second book of his Similitudes, distinguishes the
thunnis from the thunnus; and so does Epicharmus, in his Muses. But
Cratinus, in his Pluti, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For I'm a thunnis, a mel&aelig;nas, or<br />
A thunnus, orphos, grayling, eel, or sea-dog.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on Fishes, says that the thunnis is a
gregarious fish, and also a migratory one. But Archestratus, who is so
fond of petty details, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the thunna's tail, which I call thunnis,<br />
That mighty fish, whose home's Byzantium.<br />
Cut it in slices, and then roast it all<br />
With accurate care, strewing on nought but salt,<br />
Most thinly spread; then sprinkle a little oil;<br />
Then eat it hot, first dipping it in brine.<br />
Or if you like to eat them dry they're good;<br />
Like the immortal gods in character,<br />
And figure too; but if you once forget,<br />
And vinegar add to them, then you spoil them.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his P&aelig;derastes, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the middle slices take<br />
<span class="linespace1">Of the choice Byzantian tunny,</span><br />
And let them be neatly hidden<br />
<span class="linespace1">Under leaves from beet-root torn.</span>
</div>

<p>Antiphanes also praises the tail of the thunnis, in his Couris, where
he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> The man who's country bred likes not to eat</span><br />

</div>

<p>And some of these iambics may be found in the Acestria, and also in the
Countryman, or Butalion. And Hipponax, as Lysanias quotes him in his
treatise on the Iambic Poets, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For one of them with rapid extravagance<br />
Feasting each day on tunnies and on cheesecakes,<br />
Like any eunuch of rich Lampsacus,<br />

Food fit for slaves.
</div>

<p>And Strattis also mentions the thunnis, in his Callipides.</p>

<p>68. There is also a fish called the hippurus, or horsetail. Aristotle,
in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says that
the hippuri lay eggs, and that these are small at first, but come to
a great size, like those of the lamprey; and that they bring forth
their young in the spring. But Dorion, in his book upon Fish, says
that the hippurus is also called the coryph&aelig;na. But Icesius calls it
the hippuris; and Epicharmus also mentions them in his Hebe's Wedding,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sharp-nosed needle-fish,<br />
And the hippurus, and bright chrysophrys.
</div>

<p>But Numenius, in his treatise on the Art of Fishing, speaking of the
nature of the fish, says that it keeps continually leaping out of the
water; on which account it is also called the Tumbler. And he uses the
following expressions about it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Or the great synodons, or tumbler hippurus.
</div>

<p>And Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Th' hippurus of Carystus is the best,<br />
And indeed all Carystian fish are good.
</div>

<p>And Ep&aelig;netus, in his Cookery Book, says that it is called also the
coryph&aelig;na.</p>

<p>69. There is another fish called the horse; and perhaps it is the same
which Epicharmus calls the hippidion, or little horse, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The coracinus colour'd like a crow,<br />
Fat, well-fed fish; the smooth hippidion,
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 478]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
The phyc&aelig;, and the tender squill . . .
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The char, the mighty tench of size enormous,<br />
The channus, and the eel; and he who roves<br />
By night, the wary pitynus; the mussel,<br />
The horse-fish, or the sea-green corydulis.
</div>

<p>And Antimachus the Colophonian mentions it in his Thebais, where he
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The hyca, or the horse-fish, or the one<br />
Which they do call the thrush.
</div>

<p>70. There is a fish, too, called the ioulis, concerning which Dorion
says, in his treatise on Fishes, "Recollect that if you boil the
ioulis, you must do it in brine; and if you roast them, you must roast
them with marjoram." And Numenius says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And ne'er neglect the medicine which keeps off<br />
To a great degree the greedy fish ioulis,<br />
And scolopendrus that doth poison dart.
</div>

<p>But the same writer calls them ioulus, and the entrails of the earth,
in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Moreover do not then the bait forget,<br />
Which on the highest hills that fringe the shore<br />
Shall soon be found. And they are called iouli,<br />
Black, eating earth&mdash;the entrails of the earth;<br />
Or the long-footed grasshopper, what time<br />
The sandy rocks are sprinkled with the foam<br />
Of the high-rising tide. Then dig them up,<br />
And stow them carefully within your bag.
</div>

<p>71. There are also fish called <ins title="Greek: kichlê">κίχλη</ins>, the sea-thrush, and
<ins title="Greek: kossyphos">κόσσυφος</ins>, the sea-blackbird. The Attic writers call the first
<ins title="Greek: kichlê">κίχλη</ins>, with an <ins title="Greek: ê">η</ins>; and the reason is as follows:&mdash;All
the feminine nouns which end in <ins title="Greek: la">λα</ins> have another <ins title="Greek: l">λ</ins>
before the <ins title="Greek: la">λα</ins>; as <ins title="Greek: Skylla">Σκύλλα</ins>, <ins title="Greek: skilla">σκίλλα</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: kolla">κόλλα</ins>, <ins title="Greek: bdella">βδέλλα</ins>, <ins title="Greek: hamilla">ἅμιλλα</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: hamalla">ἅμαλλα</ins>: but those which end in <ins title="Greek: lê">λη</ins> do not require a <ins title="Greek: l">λ</ins> to precede the
<ins title="Greek: lê">λη</ins>; as <ins title="Greek: homichlê">ὁμίχλη</ins>, <ins title="Greek: phytlê">φύτλη</ins>, <ins title="Greek: genethlê">γενέθλη</ins>, <ins title="Greek: aiglê">αἴγλη</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: trôglê">τρώγλη</ins>, and, in like manner, <ins title="Greek: triglê">τρίγλη</ins>.
Cratinus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Suppose a man had eaten a red mullet (<ins title="Greek: triglên">τρίγλην</ins>),<br />
Would that alone prove him an epicure?
</div>

<p>And Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on Wholesomes, says,
"Those fish which are called rocky fish have tender flesh; such as the
sea-blackbird, the sea-thrush, the perch, the tench, the phyca, the
alphesticus." But Numenius says, in his treatise on Fishing&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 479]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
The sea-born race of grayling or of orphus,<br />
The black-flesh'd blackbird, or the dainty sea-thrush<br />
Sporting beneath the waves.
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Bambradones, sea-thrushes, and sea-hares;<br />
And the bold dragon-fish.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on What concerns Animals, says, "And the
fishes with black spots, like the sea-blackbird; and the fishes with
variegated spots, like the sea-thrush." But Pancrates the Arcadian,
in his Works of the Sea, says that the sea-thrush is called by many
names:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Add now to these the sea-thrush red, which they<br />
Who seek to snare the wary fish with bait<br />
Do call the saurus, and th' &aelig;olias,<br />
Add too th' orphiscus with his large fat head.
</div>

<p>And Nicander, in the fourth book of his Transformed People, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The scarus or the thrush with many names.
</div>

<p>72. There is also the sea-boar and the cremys. Aristotle, in his
treatise on Animals, says, "But some fish have no teeth and smooth
skins, like the needle-fish; and some have stony heads, like the
cremys; and some are harsher, with rough skins, like the sea-boar; and
some are marked down the back with two lines, like the seserinus; and
some are marked with many lines and with red spots, like the salpe."
And both Dorion and Ep&aelig;natus mention the sea-boar; and Archestratus
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when you go to Acta's favour'd land,<br />
If you by chance should see a rich sea-boar,<br />
Buy it at once, and let it not escape you,<br />
Not if you buy it at its weight in gold;<br />
Else will the indignation of the gods<br />
O'erpower you; for 'tis the flower of nectar.<br />
But 'tis not all men who can be allow'd<br />
To eat this dainty, no, nor e'en to see it;<br />
Unless they take a strongly-woven mesh<br />
Of marsh-bred rush, and hold it in their hands,<br />
Well used to ply the floats with rapid mind.<br />
And with these dainties you must offer up,<br />
Thrown on the ground, some gifts of lamb and mutton.
</div>

<p>73. There is also the harp-fish. Aristotle, in his treatise on Animals,
or on Fish, says, "The harp-fish has serrated teeth, is a fish of
solitary habits, he lives on seaweed; he has a very loose tongue, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 480]</span>

a white and broad heart." Pherecrates, in his Slave-Tutor, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The harp-fish is a good fish; be you sure<br />
To buy him when you can. He really is good;<br />
But, I by Ph&oelig;bus swear, this does perplex me<br />
Exceedingly which men do say, my friend,<br />
That there is secret harm within this harp-fish.
</div>

<p>Epicharmus says, in his Marriage of Hebe&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were hy&aelig;nides,<br />
And fine buglossi, and the harp-fish too.
</div>

<p>And Apollodorus has said that, on account of his name, he was
considered to be sacred to Apollo. And Callias, or Diocles, whichever
was the author of the play, says in the Cyclops&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A roasted harp-fish, and a ray,<br />
And the head of a well-fed tunny.
</div>

<p>And Archestratus, in his Luxurious Way of Living, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I counsel you always to boil a harp-fish<br />
If he is white and full of firmish meat;<br />
But if he's red and also no great size,<br />
Then it were best, when you have prick'd him o'er<br />
With a new-sharpen'd knife, to roast him gently.<br />
Sprinkle him then with oil and plenteous cheese,<br />
For he does like to see men liberal,<br />
And is himself intemperate.
</div>

<p>74. There is also the cordylus. Aristotle calls this fish an amphibious
animal, and says that it dies if it is dried by the sun. But Numenius,
in his book on the Art of Fishing, calls it the courylus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
All things are ready. First I strip the thighs<br />
Of courylus, or pirene, and treat too<br />
In the same way the marine grasshopper.
</div>

<p>He also speaks of the fish called the cordylis, in these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Mussels, sea-horses, or the sea-green cordylis.
</div>

<p>75. There is also a fish called cammorus. Epicharmus, in his Marriage
of Hebe, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then after this there are boaces and<br />
Smarides, anchovies, also cammori.
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his Female Farces, mentions them. But they are a
species of squill, and this name was given them by the Romans.</p>

<p>76. There is also a fish called the carcharias. Numenius of Heraclea,
in his Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 481]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
At times you may too a carcharias catch,<br />
At times a psamathis who loves the surf.
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his Tunny-hunter, says, "But if your stomach happens
to have swallowed a carcharias." But Nicander the Colophonian, in his
essay on Dialects, says that the carcharias is also called the lamias
and the squill.</p>

<p>77. There is also the cestreus. Icesius says, "Of the fish which are
called by one general name of leucisci there are many sorts; for some
are called cephali, and some cestres, and some chellones, and some
myxini. But the cephali are the best both in flavour and juiciness;
the next to them are those called the cestres; the myxini are inferior
to either. But the worst of all are the chellones, which are called
bacchi; and they are all full of wholesome juice, not very nutritious,
but very digestible." And Dorion, in his essay on Fish, mentions the
sea cestreus, but does not approve of the river one. And the sea
cestreus he subdivides into two species&mdash;the cephalus and the nestis.
But the cestreus, which is like the sea-urchin about the head, he calls
sphondylus. And he says "that the cephalinus differs from the cephalus,
and that this last is also called the blepsias." But Aristotle says,
in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, "But of the
different kinds of cestreus, the chellones begin to be pregnant in the
month Poseideon; so does the sargus and the fish called the myxus; and
so does the cephalus: and they go thirty days with young. But some of
the cestres are not generated by copulation, but are produced by the
slime and the sand."</p>

<p>And in other places Aristotle says, "The cestreus is a fish with
serrated teeth, but he does not eat other fishes; and, indeed, he is in
no respect carnivorous. But of these fish there are several kinds&mdash;the
cephalus, the chellon, and the pher&aelig;us. And the chellon feeds close to
land, but the pher&aelig;us does not; and they use the following food&mdash;the
pher&aelig;us uses the mucus which proceeds from itself, and the chellon eats
slime and sand. It is said, also, that the spawn of the cestreus is not
eaten by any other fish, just as the cestreus also eats no other fish."
But Euthydemus the Athenian, in his treatise on Cured Fish, says that
the spheneus and the dactyleus are both different species of cestres;
and also that there is a species which are called cephali, because they
have very large heads. And those which are called spheneus,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
are called so because they are thin and four-cornered; and the dactyleis

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 482]</span>

are not so thick as two fingers. But the most excellent of the cestres
are those which are caught near Abdera, as Archestratus has told us;
and the second-best are those which come from Sinope.</p>

<p>78. But the cestres are called by some writers plotes, as Polemo says,
in his treatise on the Rivers in Sicily. And Epicharmus, in his Muses,
gives them this name&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
&AElig;olians, and plotes, and cynoglossi.<br />
<span class="linespace1">There also were sciathides.</span>
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on the Dispositions and Way of Living of
Animals, says that "the cestres live even if they are deprived of their
tails. But the cestreus is eaten by the pike, and the conger is eaten
by the turbot." And there is an often-quoted proverb, "The cestreus
is fasting," which is applied to men who live with strict regard to
justice, because the cestreus is never carnivorous. Anaxilas, in his
Morose Man, attacking Maton the Sophist for his gluttony, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Maton seized hold of a large cestreus' head,<br />
And ate it all. But I am quite undone.
</div>

<p>And that beautiful writer, Archestratus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Buy if you can a cestreus which has come<br />
From the sea-girt &AElig;gina; then you shall<br />
For well-bred men be fitting company.
</div>

<p>Diocles, in his Sea, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cestreus leaps for joy.
</div>

<p>79. But that the nestes are a kind of cestreus, Archippus tells us, in
his Hercules Marrying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Nestes cestres, cephali.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Lampon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But all the other soldiers which you have<br />
Are hungry (<ins title="Greek: nêsteis">νήστεις</ins>) cestres.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Phrygian, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
So I a nestis cestreus now run home.
</div>

<p>Ameipsias says, in his Men playing at the Cottabus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And Euphron says, in his Ugly Woman&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Midas then is a cestreus&mdash;see, he walks<br />
Along the city fasting (<ins title="Greek: nêstis">νῆστις</ins>).

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 483]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>And Philemon says, in his Men dying together&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I bought me now a nestis cestreus roasted<br />
Of no great size.
</div>

<p>Aristophanes, in his Gerytades, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

For that they all are <ins title="Greek: nêstides">νήστιδες</ins> you know.

<p>Anaxandrides says, in his Ulysses&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He usually goes supperless about,<br />
Like a cestrinus nestis.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus, in his Nausicaa, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Who has been drown'd 'tis now four days ago,<br />
Leading the life of a sad nestis cestreus.
</div>

<p>80. When all this had been said about this nice dish of fish, one of
the cynics coming late in the evening said, "My friends, are we, too,
keeping a fast, as if this were the middle day of the Thesmophoria,
since we are now fasting like cestres? For, as Diphilus says, in his
Lemnian Women&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
These men have supp'd, but I, wretch that I am,<br />
Shall be a cestreus through th' extreme of fasting.
</div>

<p>And Myrtilus answering, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But stand in order&mdash;
</div>

<p>as the Hedychares of Theopompus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace8">hungry band of cestres,</span><br />
You who are fed, like geese, on vegetables.
</div>

<p>For you shall not take a share of any of these things before either
you, or your fellow-pupil Ulpian, tell me why the cestreus is the
only fish which is called the faster. And Ulpian said,&mdash;It is because
he never takes any living bait; and when he is caught, it is neither
effected by any meat nor by any living animal; as Aristotle tells
us, when he says "perhaps his being hungry makes him lazy;" and also
that "when he is frightened he hides his head, as if by so doing he
concealed his whole body." But Plato, in his Holidays, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
As I was going out I met a fisherman,<br />
And he was bringing me some cestres, and<br />
He brought me all those worthless starving fish.
</div>

<p>But do you tell me, O you Thessalian wrestler, Myrtilus! why it is
that fish are called by the poets <ins title="Greek: ellopes">ἔλλοπες</ins>? And he said,&mdash;It
is because they are voiceless; but some insist upon it that, by
strict analogy, the word ought to be <ins title="Greek: illopes">ἴλλοπες</ins>, because they
are deprived of voice: for the verb <ins title="Greek: illesthai">ἴλλεσθαι</ins> means to be

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 484]</span>

deprived, and <ins title="Greek: ops">ὄψ</ins> means voice.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
And are you ignorant of this, when you are an <ins title="Greek: ellops">ἔλλοψ</ins> yourself?
But I, as the wise Epicharmus says, when this dog makes me no
answer,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Am by myself enough well to reply<br />
To what two men have lately said before me.
</div>

<p>And I say that they are called <ins title="Greek: ellopes">ἔλλοπες</ins> from being covered with
scales, [the word coming from the same root, and being equivalent to
<ins title="Greek: lepidôtos">λεπιδωτός</ins>]. But I will tell you (though that is not a question
which has been asked) why the Pythagoreans, who do touch other living
creatures, though sparingly, and who allow themselves even to sacrifice
some, absolutely abstain altogether from fish alone. Is it because of
their silence? for they think silence a very divine quality. Since,
then, you, O you Molossian dogs, are always silent, but are still not
Pythagoreans, we will now go on to the rest of the discussion about
fish.</p>

<p>81. There is a fish called the coracinus. The coracini, which are
caught at sea, says Icesius, contain but little nourishment; but they
are easily secreted, and have a moderate supply of good juice. But
Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, says that "it
happens to nearly all fish to have a rapid growth, and this is the
case, in no small degree, with the coracinus; and he lays his eggs
close to the land, in places full of weeds and moss." But Speusippus,
in the second book of his treatise on Similitudes, says that the
blacktail and the coracinus are much alike. But Numenius, in his
Treatise on the Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
It easily would attract the spotted coracinus.
</div>

<p>And perhaps the &aelig;oli&aelig; mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Muses, may be the
same as coracini. For Epicharmus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
&AElig;oli&aelig;, plotes, cynoglossi too.
</div>

<p>But, in his Hebe's Marriage, he speaks of the &aelig;oli&aelig; as a different
fish; for he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There there were mussels, and the alphastic fish,<br />
And coracini like to coriander seed,<br />
&AElig;oli&aelig;, plotes too, and the cynoglossi.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 485]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>But Euthydemus, in his essay on Cured Fish, says that the coracinus
is by many people called the saperda. And Heracleon the Ephesian has
said much the same thing; and so has Philotimus, in his Cookery Book.
But that the saperdas and the coracinus are both called the platistacus
is affirmed by Parmeno the Rhodian, in the first book of his Culinary
Doctrine. But Aristophanes, in his Telmessians, uses the expression
"black-finned coracini."</p>

<p>Pherecrates also uses the word in its diminutive form, in his Forgetful
Man, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Being with your <ins title="Greek: korakinidia">κορακινίδια</ins> and <ins title="Greek: mainidia">μαινίδια</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Amphis says, in his Ialemus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Whoever eats a sea-born coracinus<br />
When he may have a grayling, is a fool.
</div>

<p>But the coracini of the Nile are very sweet and delicious in their
flesh, as those who have tried them know; and they have got their name
from continually moving their eyes (<ins title="Greek: dia to tas koras kinein">διὰ τὸ τὰς κόρας κινεῖν</ins>),
and never ceasing. But the Alexandrians call them plataces, which is,
more correctly speaking, the name of the whole genus.</p>

<p>82. There is also a fish called the cyprinus, or carp. He also, as
Aristotle tells us, is a carnivorous and gregarious fish; and he has
his tongue, not in the lower part of the mouth, but in the upper part.
But Dorion, mentioning him in his list among the lake and river fish,
writes thus: "A scaly fish, whom some people call the cyprinus."</p>

<p>83. There is also the tench. "The tench is very juicy," as Icesius
says, "exceedingly attractive to the palate, very easily secreted,
not very nutritious, nor is the juice which they give very wholesome.
But, in delicacy of flavour, the white kind is superior to the black.
But the flesh of the green tench is more dry, and devoid of fat; and
they give a much smaller quantity of juice, and what they do give is
thinner. Still they are more nutritious, on account of their size."
Diocles says that those which are found in rocky situations are very
tender. But Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, calls them, not
<ins title="Greek: kôbioi">κωβιοι</ins>, but <ins title="Greek: kôthoi">κωθοι</ins>.</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A char or tench (<ins title="Greek: kôthos">κωθος</ins>) of mighty size and bold.
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his Countryman, speaks of "The cothons, who bathe in
mud;" and perhaps it was from the name of this fish that he called
the son of his Tunny-catcher, in the play, Cothonias. But it is
the Sicilians who call the tench <ins title="Greek: kôthôn">κώθων</ins>, as Nicander the
Colophonian tells us, in his book on Dialects; and Apollodorus

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 486]</span>

confirms the statement, in his treatise on the Modest and Temperate
Man. But Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, names the tench, calling
it <ins title="Greek: kôbios">κώβιος</ins>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The turtle with their sting behind, and then the tender tench.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Timon, praising the tench, tells us in what
places they are to be found in the greatest perfection, in these
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I come, but I have been to great expense<br />
In buying viands for this marriage feast.<br />
I've bought a pennyworth of frankincense<br />
To offer to the gods and all the goddesses;<br />
And to the heroes I will offer cakes.<br />
But when I bid that rascally house-breaking<br />
Seller of fish to add a dainty dish,<br />
"I'll throw you in," says he, "the borough itself,<br />

</div>

<p>Menander, in his Ephesians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> There was a fishmonger not long ago,</span><br />
Who asked four whole drachmas for his tench.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> A mighty price indeed.</span>
</div>

<p>And Dorion mentions river tench also, in his book on Fishes.</p>

<p>84. There is also a fish called the cuckoo-fish. Epicharmus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the beauteous cuckoos<br />
Which we split in twain,<br />
Then we roast and season them,<br />
And then with pleasure eat them.
</div>

<p>And Dorion says that one ought to roast them, first having split them
down the back; and, having seasoned them with herbs, and cheese, and
spice, and assaf&oelig;tida, and oil, then one ought to turn them round, and
oil them on the other side, and then to sprinkle them with a little
salt; and, when one has taken them from the fire, to moisten them with
vinegar. But Numenius gives it the epithet of red, from the facts of
the case, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Eating sometimes the cuckoo red, sometimes<br />
A few pempherides, or else a lizard.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 487]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>85. There is also a fish called the carcharias (or sharp-toothed
dog). And Archestratus, whom we may call the Hesiod or Theognis of
Epicures, speaks of this fish; for Theognis himself was not indifferent
to luxury, as he admits, speaking of himself in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when the sun, driving his coursers fleet<br />
With solid hoofs along the heavenly road,<br />
Guides them at mid-day in the centre path,<br />
Then let us eat whate'er our heart may prompt,<br />
And gratify our appetite with dainties.<br />
Then let a Spartan maid with rosy hands,<br />
Bring water, and fresh garlands for our brows.
</div>

<p>Nor indeed was that wise man indifferent to the charms of boys; at all
events, he speaks thus on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O Academus, would you now but sing<br />
A tuneful hymn, while in the midst should stand<br />
A beauteous boy, in flower of his youth,<br />
A prize for you and me to combat for,<br />
Then you should know how far the mule excels the ass.
</div>

<p>And Archestratus, in these beautiful suggestions of his, exhorts his
friends in this way&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In fair Torone's town 'tis best to cook<br />
The hollow entrails of the sharp-tooth'd dog.<br />
Then strew the fish with cummin, sparing be<br />
Of salt, then roast him, and add nothing else<br />
Saving some sea-green oil. Then when 'tis done,<br />
Serve him up with some little seasoning.<br />
And if you boil a part of it within<br />
The hollow of some flat dish, then add<br />
No water, add no wine-made vinegar,<br />
But pour on oil alone, and cummin dry,<br />
And add what fragrant herbs the garden gives.<br />
Then put the saucepan on the ashes hot,<br />
And boil it; let no flame too quickly burn,<br />
And stir it often lest the meat should catch,<br />
And spoil your dinner so, before you know it.<br />
'Tis but few mortals know this wondrous food;<br />
And those who have thick stupid heavy souls,<br />
Refuse to taste it, but are all alarm'd,<br />
Because they say this dog's a cannibal,<br />
And feeds on human flesh. But there is not<br />
A fish that swims which does not like man's flesh<br />
If he can only chance to come across it.
</div>

<p>There is a part of this fish which the Romans call thursio, and which
is very delicious, and much sought for as an article of luxury.</p>

<p>86. There is also the pike. These, as Aristotle reports, are a solitary
and carnivorous fish; and they have a bony tongue, adhering to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 488]</span>

mouth, and a triangular heart. But, in the fifth book of his Parts of
Animals, he says that they bring forth their young, like the cestres
and chrysophryes do, chiefly in those places where rivers fall into the
sea; and they bring forth in winter, and they also bring forth twice
in the season. But Icesius says that the pike is very juicy, and not
very nutritious; and that it is also not very easily secreted; but
for delicacy of flavour it is accounted the very first of fish. And
this fish has his name, <ins title="Greek: labrax">λάβραξ</ins>, from his voracity
<ins title="Greek: labrotês">λαβρότης</ins>. It is said, also, that in
shrewdness he is superior to other fish,
being very ingenious at devising means to save himself; on which
account, Aristophanes the comic poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The pike, the wisest of all fish that swim.
</div>

<p>And Alc&aelig;us the lyric poet says that he swims very high in the water.
But the wise Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Take the large cestris cephalus from G&aelig;son,<br />
When you do come to fair Miletus' city.<br />
Take too the pike, the offspring of the gods.<br />
For in those waters both these fish are best.<br />
Such is the natural character of the place.<br />
But there are many places where they grow<br />
More fat and large; in famous Calydon,<br />
And in the opulent Ambracia,<br />
And at the Bolbe lake; but there they want<br />
The fragrant fat which here surrounds their belly;<br />
Nor have they such a pungent taste, my friend.<br />
Those which I speak of are most admirable.<br />
Take them and roast them without scaling them,<br />
Soften with salt, and serve them up with brine.<br />
And let no Syracusan, no Italian<br />
Break in upon you while you dress this dish:<br />
For they have no idea of dressing fish,<br />
But spoil them all by seasoning them with cheese,<br />
By sprinkling them with too much vinegar,<br />
And strongly scented assaf&oelig;tida.<br />
They are good cooks enough to dress the vile<br />
Fish which they take while clinging to the rocks;<br />
And there are many kinds of season'd dishes<br />
Which they can dress quite well enough; but they<br />
Have no idea of dressing good fish plain.
</div>

<p>87. And Aristophanes, in his Knights, speaks of the pike taken in the
neighbourhood of Miletus as surpassingly good, when he speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But you shall not disturb me thus<br />
Feasting on Milesian pike.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 489]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PIKE.</div>

<p>And in his Lemnian Women he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He would not buy a pike's head, nor a locust:
</div>

<p>speaking because the brain of the pike is a great delicacy, as is also
that of the sea-grayling. And Eubulus, in his Muses, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Do not be too expensive, still not mean,<br />
Whate'er you do; not for decency's sake.<br />
Get some small cuttle-fish, or squids, some nestis,<br />
Some small fry of the polypus, some tripe,<br />
And beestings and black-puddings; get besides<br />
A noble head of the Milesian pike.
</div>

<p>But the G&aelig;son, which is mentioned by Archestratus, means the lake
G&aelig;sonis, which is between Priene and Miletus, connected with the sea,
as Neanthes of Cyzicus tells us, in the sixth book of his Hellenics.
But Ephorus, in his fifth book, says that the G&aelig;son is a river near
Priene, which flows into the lake G&aelig;sonis. And Archippus, in his
Fishes, mentioning the pike, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Hermes th' Egyptian is the greatest rogue<br />
Of all the fishmongers; he skins by force<br />
The sharks and rhinès, and takes out the entrails<br />
Of the Milesian pikes, before he sells them.
</div>

<p>88. There is also a fish called the latus; and Archestratus says that
the best fish of this kind is that which is taken off the coast of
Italy, and he speaks thus concerning them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Near the well-treed Italia's verdant shores,<br />
Fierce Scylla's strait the famous latus breeds,<br />
Most marvellous of dainties.
</div>

<p>But the lati which are found in the river Nile grow to such a size that
they weigh more than two hundred pounds; and this fish is exceedingly
white, and very delicious, dress it in whatever way you choose. And
it is like the fish called the glanis, which is found in the Danube.
The Nile produces also many other kinds of fish, and they are all very
delicious; but especially does it produce all the different coracini
(for there are many different kinds of this fish). It also produces
the fish called the m&aelig;otes, which are mentioned by Archippus, in his
Fishes, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
M&aelig;ot&aelig;, and saperd&aelig;, likewise glanides.
</div>

<p>And this fish is found in great numbers in Pontus; and they derive
their name from the Palus M&aelig;otis. But the following, as far as I can
recollect, from having been a long time absent from the country, are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 490]</span>

the names of the chief fish found in the Nile. The sweetest of all is
the ray; then there is the sea-pig, the snub-nose, the phagrus, the
oxyrhynchus, the allabes, the silurus, the synodontis, the elecoris,
the eel, the thrissa, the abramis, the blind-fish, the scaly-fish, the
bellows-fish, and the cestreus. And there are also a great number of
others.</p>

<p>89. There is also a kind of shark, called the leiobatus, whose other
name is the rhin&egrave;; and he is a white-fleshed fish, as Ep&aelig;netus tells us
in his Cookery Book. Plato says, in his Sophists&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The galeus, the leiobatus, the eel.
</div>

<p>90. There is also the lamprey. Theophrastus, in the fifth book of
his treatise on those Animals which can live on dry Land, says that
the eel and the lamprey can exist for a long time out of the water,
because they have very small gills, and so receive but very little
moisture into their system. But Icesius affirms that they are not
less nutritious than the eel, nor even, perhaps, than the conger. And
Aristotle, in his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says that from the
time that they are little they grow very rapidly, and that they have
sharp serrated teeth; and that they keep on laying small-sized eggs
every season of the year. But Epicharmus, in his Muses, calls them
not <ins title="Greek: smyraina">σμύραινα</ins>, but <ins title="Greek: myraina">μύραινα</ins>, without the <ins title="Greek: s">σ</ins>;
speaking in this way of them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No congers fat were wanting, and no lampreys (<ins title="Greek: myrainai">μύραιναι</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Sophron, too, spells the word in the same manner. But Plato or
Cantharus, in his Alliance, spells the word with the <ins title="Greek: s">σ</ins>,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The ray, the lamprey (<ins title="Greek: smyraina">σμύραινα</ins>) too, is here.
</div>

<p>Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, says that the river lampreys have
only one spine, like the kind of cod which is called gallarias. But
Andreas, in his treatise on Poisonous Animals, says that those lampreys
which are produced by a cross with the viper have a poisonous bite, and
that that kind is less round than the other, and is variegated. But
Nicander, in his Theriacus, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 491]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
That is a terrible deed the lamprey does,<br />
When oft its teeth it gnashes and pursues<br />
Th' unhappy fishermen, and drives them headlong<br />
Out of their boats in haste, when issuing forth<br />
From the deep hole in which it long has lain:<br />
If that the tale is true that it admits<br />
The poisonous viper's love, when it deserts<br />
Its pastures 'neath the sea, for food on land.
</div>

<p>But Andreas, in his treatise on Things which are believed erroneously,
says that it is quite a mistake to suppose that the lamprey ever breeds
with the viper when it comes on marshy ground; for that vipers do not
themselves feed in marshes, as they are fond rather of sandy and desert
places. But Sostratus, in his books on Animals (and there are two books
of his on this subject, and with this title), agrees with those who
assert that the lamprey and the viper do breed together.</p>

<p>91. There is another kind of eel also, called the myrus. But the myrus,
as Aristotle says, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of
Animals, differs from the lamprey; this latter being a variegated fish,
and less powerful than the other; while the myrus is a fish of one
uniform colour, and strong, and its whole colour is like that of the
wryneck, and it has teeth both within and without. And Dorion says,
that the myrus has no small bones running through its flesh, but that
it is in every part eatable, and exceedingly soft; and that there are
two kinds of it, for some are black, and some are of rather a fiery
colour, but those which are dark are best. And Archestratus, the
voluptuary philosopher, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Between th' Italian and Sicilian shore,<br />
Where the strait parts them with its narrow waves,<br />
Whenever that most dainty fish is caught<br />
Which men the lamprey call, be sure to buy it;<br />
For in those waters 'tis the best of food.
</div>

<p>92. There is a fish, too, called the m&aelig;nis, or sprat; and Icesius says
that they are more juicy than the tench, but that they are inferior in
delicacy of flavour, and also in the extent to which they facilitate
the secretions of the stomach. But Speusippus, in the second book of
his treatise on Things similar to one another, says that both the boax
and the smaris resemble the sprat; and these two fishes are mentioned
by Epicharmus, in his Earth and Sea, in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When you see many boaces and smarides.
</div>

<p>And Ep&aelig;netus, in his Cookery Book, says, "The smaris, which some people
call cynoseuna." But Antiphanes, in his Countryman, or Butalion, calls
the sprats the food of Hecate, on account of their diminutive size;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 492]</span>

and the following is the passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Why, I did think that all these monstrous fish</span><br />
Were cannibals.<br />
<span class="linespace6"><i>B.</i> What can you mean, my friend?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Why, cannibals: so how would any man eat them?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> That's true. But these are food of Hecate,</span><br />
Which he is speaking of, just sprats and mullets.
</div>

<p>There is also one kind which is called the leucom&aelig;nis, or white sprat,
which some people call the boax. Poliochus, in his Corinthiastes, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let no man, in God's name I beg, persuade you,<br />
Come when he will or whence, so to mistake<br />
As to call leucom&aelig;nides boaces.
</div>

<p>93. There is also the melanurus, or blacktail; and concerning this fish
Numenius says, in his Art of Fishing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The scorpion or melanurus black,<br />
The guide and leader of the perch.
</div>

<p>But Icesius says that he is very like the sargus, but that he is
inferior to the latter in the quantity and quality of his juice, and
also in delicacy of flavour; but that he is rather exciting food, and
very nutritious. And Epicharmus mentions him in his Hebe's Marriage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were sargini, there were melanuri.
</div>

<p>Aristotle too, in his treatise on Animals, writes thus: "There are some
fish which have barred or spotted tails, among which are the melanuri,
and the sargi or sardine; and they have many lines on their skin, dark
lines. But Speusippus affirms, in the second book of his treatise on
Things similar to one another, that the fish called psyrus resembles
the melanurus; but Numenius calls the psyrus, psorus, with an <ins title="Greek: o">ο</ins>,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The psorus, or the salpe, or the dragon-fish<br />
Which haunts the shore.
</div>

<p>94. There is also a fish called the mormyrus, a most nutritious fish,
as Icesius says. But Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, calls it the
myrmes, unless, at least, he means a different fish by this name. But
his expression is&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sea-swallow, the myrmes too,<br />
And they are larger than the colias tunny.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 493]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>But Dorion, in his book upon Fishes, calls them mormylus, with a <ins title="Greek: l">λ</ins>.
But Lynceus of Samos, in his treatise on the Art of buying
Fish, which he addressed to some friend of his, who
was very difficult to please when making his purchases, says, "But it
is not a useless plan, with reference to men who are obstinate, and who
will not abate their price, when you are standing by to disparage their
fish, quoting Archestratus (who wrote the book called The voluptuous
Life), or some other poet, and repeating this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The mormyrus that haunts the pebbly shore,<br />
Is a bad, good-for-nothing, worthless fish.
</div>

<p>And again you may quote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Buy an amia in the autumn . . . .
</div>

<p>'But now 'tis spring.' And again you may proceed, if it should be the
proper season&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
How good the cestreus is when winter comes.
</div>

<p>'But now,' you will say, 'it is summer.' And you will go on in this way
for some time; and in this way you will drive away a good many of those
who are standing about, and who might become purchasers. So when you
have done this, you will by this means compel the man to take whatever
price you choose to give."</p>

<p>95. There is also the torpedo. Plato, or Cantharus, says, in the
Alliance&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A boil'd torpedo is delicious food.
</div>

<p>But Plato the Philosopher says, in the Meno, "You seem very much to
resemble the sea-torpedo; for that fish causes any one who comes near
it to become torpid." And an allusion to the name occurs also in Homer,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
His hand was torpid (<ins title="Greek: narkêse">νάρκησε</ins>) at the wrist.
</div>

<p>But Menander, in his Phanus, uses the termination <ins title="Greek: a">α</ins>, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A certain torpor (<ins title="Greek: narka">νάρκα</ins>) creeps o'er all my skin;
</div>

<p>though no one of the ancient writers ever used this form of the word.
But Icesius says that it is a fish without much nutriment or much juice
in it, but that it has some cartilaginous sort of substance diffused
all over it, very good for the stomach. And Theophrastus, in his book
on Animals which live in Holes, says that the torpedo works its way
underground because of the cold. But in his treatise on Poisonous
Animals, and on Animals which sting, he says that the torpedo can send
the power which proceeds from it through wood, and through harpoons,
so as to produce torpor in those who have them in their hands. But

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 494]</span>

Clearchus the Solensian has explained the cause of this in his treatise
on Torpor; but, since his explanation is rather a long one, I do not
recollect his exact words, but will refer you to the treatise itself.</p>

<p>But the torpedo, says Aristotle, is one of the cartilaginous and
viviparous fish; and, to provide itself with food, it hunts after
little fish, touching them, and causing them all to become torpid and
motionless. And Diphilus of Laodicea, in his essay on the Theriaca of
Nicander, says that it is not every part of the animal which produces
this torpor, but only some particular parts of it; and he says that
he has arrived at this fact by a long series of experiments. But
Archestratus speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A boil'd torpedo done in oil and wine,<br />
And fragrant herbs, and some thin grated cheese.
</div>

<p>Alexis, in his Galatea, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I counsel you to season well and stuff<br />
Torpedos whole, and then to roast them thoroughly.
</div>

<p>And in his Demetrius he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then I took a torpedo, calculating<br />
If my wife touch'd it with her tender fingers<br />
That they would get no hurt from its backbone.
</div>

<p>96. There is also the sword-fish. Aristotle says that this fish has its
lower jaw short, but its upper one bony, long, and in fact as large as
all the rest of the body of the fish; and this upper jaw is what is
called the sword; but that this fish has no teeth. And Archestratus
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But take a slice of sword-fish when you go<br />
To fair Byzantium, and take the vertebr&aelig;<br />
Which bend his tail. He's a delicious fish,<br />
Both there and where the sharp Pelorian cape<br />
Juts out towards the sea.

<p>Now, who is then so great a general, or so great a critic in dishes
and banquets, as this poet from Gela<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
(or, I should rather say, from Catagela), who, for the sake of his
epicurism, sailed through those straits; and who also, for the sake of
the same epicurism, investigated the different qualities and juices
of each separate part of every fish, as if he had been laying the
foundation of some science which was useful to human life?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 495]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>97. There is also a fish called the orphos (<ins title="Greek: orphôs">ὄρφως</ins>); but the
word is also spelt with an <ins title="Greek: o">ο</ins> (<ins title="Greek: orphos">ὄρφος</ins>), as Pamphilus
tells us. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals,
where he says that the growth of most fish is very rapid, says,
"The orphos also grows to a large fish from a little one with great
rapidity; but he is a carnivorous fish, with serrated teeth, and of a
solitary disposition. And there is this peculiarity in him, that it
cannot be ascertained what means he has of propagating his species, and
that he can live a long time after he has been cut in pieces. He is
also one of those fish which bury themselves in holes during the winter
season, and he is fond of keeping close to the land, rather than of
going into the deep sea; but he does not live more than two years. And
Numenius, speaking of this fish, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now with such baits as these it is not hard<br />
To draw the lengthy scorpion from his bed,<br />
Or the rough orphus: for they're easily caught.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The grayling, or the sea-born race of orphi,<br />
Or the dark flesh'd sea-blackbird.
</div>

<p>But Dorion says that the young orphus is called by some the orphacines.
And Archippus says, in his Fishes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The orphus came to them, the priest o' the god.
</div>

<p>And Cratinus says, in his Ulysses,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A hot slice of the newly taken orphus.
</div>

<p>And Plato, in his Cleophon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For he has brought you here, old dame, to dwell,<br />
A rotten food for orphi and for phagri,<br />
And other gristly boneless fish around.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If a man be inclined to purchase orphi,<br />
And likes to leave alone the membrades.
</div>

<p>Now this word <ins title="Greek: orphôs">ὀρφὼς</ins>, in the nominative case singular, is
accented with an acute on the ultima by the Attic writers; so Archippus
writes the word, in his Fishes, in the lines which I have already
quoted; and Cratinus also, in his Ulysses, as I have above quoted it,
writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: temachos orphô chliaron">τέμαχος ὀρφὼ χλιαρόν</ins>.
</div>

<p>98. There is also a fish called orcynus. Dorion, in his treatise on
Fishes, says that the orcyni come from the sea near the Pillars of
Hercules to the waters on our coasts; on which account, a great number

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 496]</span>

are taken in the Iberian and Tyrrhenian seas; and that from thence
they are dispersed over the rest of the sea. But Icesius says that
those which are caught near Cadiz are the fattest, and next to them
those which are taken near Sicily. But that those which are taken at
any great distance from the Pillars of Hercules have very little fat
on them, because they have swum a very great distance. Accordingly,
at Cadiz, it is only the shoulders by themselves which are dried and
cured; as also it is only the jaws and palate of the sturgeon, and that
part which is called the melandryas, which is cured. But Icesius says
that the entrails are very rich, and very different in flavour from the
other parts; and that the parts about the shoulders are superior even
to these.</p>

<p>99. There is also the cod and the hake. The cod, says Aristotle, in his
work on Living Animals, has a large wide mouth like the shark, and he
is not a gregarious fish; and he is the only fish which has his heart
in his stomach, and in his brain he has stones like millstones. And he
is the only fish who buries himself in a hole in the hot weather, when
the Dog-star rages; for all others take to their holes in the winter
season. And these fish are mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Hebe's
Wedding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And there are chann&aelig; with their large wide mouths,<br />
And cod with their huge bellies.
</div>

<p>But the cod is different from the hake, as Dorion tells us, in his work
upon Fish, where he writes thus: "The <ins title="Greek: onos">ὄνος</ins> (cod), which some
call <ins title="Greek: gados">γάδος</ins>." There is also the gallerides, which some call a
hake, and some a maxinus. But Euthydemus, in his work on Cured Fish,
says, "Some call this fish the bacchus, and some call it the gelaria,
and some call it the hake." But Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Anthedon's famous for its cod, which some<br />
Do call gallerias; there its size is great,<br />
But the flesh spongy, and in many respects<br />
I do not think it good, though others praise it.<br />
But this man likes one thing, and that another.
</div>

<p>100. There is the polypus, declined <ins title="Greek: polypous">πολύπους</ins>, <ins title="Greek: polypodos">πολύποδος</ins>; at least this is the way the Attic writers use the word,
and so does Homer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
As when a polypus (<ins title="Greek: poulypodos">πουλύποδος</ins> in the genitive) is dragged from out his lair:
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 497]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>keeping the analogy to the noun <ins title="Greek: pous">ποὺς</ins>, from which it is
derived. But in the accusative case we find the form <ins title="Greek: polypoun">πολύπουν</ins>,
just as we find <ins title="Greek: Alkinoun">Ἀλκίνουν</ins> and <ins title="Greek: Oidipoun">Οἰδίπουν</ins>. &AElig;schylus,
too, has the form <ins title="Greek: tripoun">τρίπουν</ins>, as an epithet of a caldron, in his
Athamas, from <ins title="Greek: pous">ποὺς</ins>, as if it were a simple noun like <ins title="Greek: nous">νοῦς</ins>. But the form <ins title="Greek: pôlypos">πώλυπος</ins> is
&AElig;olic. For the Attics always say <ins title="Greek: polypous">πολύπους</ins>. Aristophanes, in his D&aelig;dalus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When then I had this polypus (<ins title="Greek: poulypous">πουλύπους</ins>) and cuttle-fish.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He put before me a polypus (<ins title="Greek: poulypoun">πουλύπουν</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in another place he has&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They are the blows of a polypus press'd tight.
</div>

<p>And Alc&aelig;us says, in his Adulterous Sisters,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The man's a fool and has the mind of a polypus (<ins title="Greek: poulypodos">πουλύποδος</ins>).
</div>

<p>But Ameipsias, in his Glutton, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I want, it seems, a heap of polypi (<ins title="Greek: poulypôn">πουλύπων</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Plato, in his Boy, writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
First of all you like the polypodes (<ins title="Greek: tous poulypodas">τοὺς πουλύποδας</ins>).
</div>

<p>Alc&aelig;us in another passage says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I myself eat like any polypus (<ins title="Greek: poulypous">πουλύπους</ins>).
</div>

<p>But others use the accusative case <ins title="Greek: polypoda">πολύποδα</ins>, in strict analogy
with <ins title="Greek: pous, podos, podi, poda">ποὺς, ποδὸς, ποδὶ, πόδα</ins>. Eupolis, in his Demi, has&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The man's a fellow-citizen of mine,<br />
A very polypus in disposition.
</div>

<p>101. Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on Wholesome Things,
says&mdash;"The molluscous fish are calculated to give pleasure, and to
excite the amorous propensities; especially the polypi (<ins title="Greek: hoi polypodes">ὁι πολυποδες</ins>)."
And Aristotle relates that the polypus has eight feet,
of which the two highest and the two lowest are the smallest, and
those in the middle are the largest; and they have also two feelers,
with which they bring their food to their mouth. And they have their
eyes placed above their two upper feet; and their mouth and teeth are
between their feet. And when the polypus is dissected, he has a brain
divided into two parts; and what is called his ink is not black, like
the cuttle-fish, but of a reddish colour, in that part of him which is
called the poppy; but the poppy lies above the stomach, like a bladder:
and it has no intestines, like other fish. But for food it uses at
times the flesh of small shell-fish, and casts the shells outside its
body; by which the hunters know where to find it. And it propagates

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 498]</span>

its species by becoming intertwined with the female, and is a long time
about it, because it is destitute of blood: and it ejects its young
through the orifice which is called the spiracle, which is the only
passage for its body; and it lays eggs in clusters, like bunches of
grapes.</p>

<p>102. They say, also, that the polypus, when it is in want of food, will
eat even itself. And among those who relate this fact is Pherecrates
the comic poet; for he, in the play entitled The Countryman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They live on green anthrysca, and on bracana,<br />
And snails and slugs. And when they're very hungry,<br />
Then, like the polypus, they e'en at night<br />
Nibble their fingers.
</div>

<p>And Diphilus, in his Merchant, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A polypus with all his feelers<br />
And limbs unhurt; whose wicked tooth<br />
Has not devour'd himself, my friend,<br />
Is ready for our supper.
</div>

<p>But all this is a mistake; for the fact is, that he is pursued by the
congers, and has his feet hurt in that manner. And it is said that if
any one strews salt over his hole, he immediately comes out. It is
also affirmed, that when he flies in alarm, he changes his colour, and
becomes like the places in which he conceals himself. As also Theognis
of Megara says, in his Elegies&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Remark the tricks of that most wary polypus,<br />
Who always seems of the same colour and hue<br />
As is the rock near which he lies.
</div>

<p>And Clearchus makes a similar statement in the second book of his
treatise on Proverbs, where he quotes the following lines, without
saying from whose writings they come&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
My son, my excellent Amphilochus,<br />
Copy the shrewd device o' the polypus,<br />
And make yourself as like as possible<br />
To those whose land you chance to visit.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 499]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE POLYPUS.</div>

<p>103. And the same Clearchus says that, in olden time, about Tr&oelig;zen,
it was considered impious to try to catch either the polypus, which
was called sacred, or that one which was called the rower. And it was
contrary to law to eat either that or the sea-tortoise. But the polypus
is a fish very apt to decay, and also very stupid; for it goes towards
the hand of the people who are pursuing it: and sometimes even
when it is pursued, it does not attempt to get out of the way. Their
females waste away after laying their eggs, and get powerless; by
reason of which they are easily taken. And sometimes they have been
seen leaving the sea, and going on dry land, especially towards any
rough or rugged ground; for they shun smooth places: and of all
plants they especially delight in the olive, and they are often found
embracing the trunk of an olive with their feelers. They have also
been discovered clinging to such fig-trees as grow near the sea-shore,
and eating the figs, as Clearchus tells us, in his treatise on those
Animals which live in the Water. And this also is a proof that they
are fond of the olive,&mdash;that if any one drops a branch of this tree
down into the sea, in a place where there are polypi, and holds it
there a little time, he without any trouble draws up as many polypi
as he pleases, clinging to the branch. And all their other parts are
exceedingly strong, but their neck is weak.</p>

<p>104. It is also said that the male has something corresponding to
the parts of generation in one of his arms, in which there are his
two large feelers; and that it is a limb full of nerves, sticking to
the arm all along as far as the middle. But, in the fifth book of
his treatise on the Parts of Animals, Aristotle says&mdash;"The polypus
propagates his species in the winter, and brings forth in the spring;
and it lies in its hole for about two months: and it is a very
prolific animal. But the male differs from the female, both in having
a longer head, and also in having what the fishermen call its parts of
generation in one of its feelers. And when it brings forth, it sits on
its eggs, on which account it is worse to eat at that season; and the
polypus lays its eggs either in its bed, or in any potsherd, or hollow
place or vessel of that sort. And after fifty days, the little polypi
come forth out of the egg in immense numbers, like young spiders.
But the female polypus sometimes sits upon the eggs, and sometimes
clings to the mouth of the bed, holding on with one of its feelers."
Theophrastus, in his treatise on those Animals which change their
Colour, says that the polypus generally becomes like only to those
places which are rocky, doing this both out of fear and for the sake
of protecting itself. But, in his book on those Animals which live
on dry Land, he says that the polypi are not fond of sea-water. But,
in his treatise on those Things which are different according to the
Differences of their Situation, Theophrastus says that there are no

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 500]</span>

polypi about the Hellespont; for that sea is cold, and not very
salt, and that both these circumstances are unfavourable to the polypus.</p>

<p>105. "But the fish called the nautilus," says Aristotle, "is not a
polypus, though it resembles a polypus in its feelers. And the back
of the nautilus is covered with a shell; and it rises up out of the
bottom of the sea, having its shell upon its back, in order that it
may not catch the water. But when it has turned round, then it sails
on, putting up two of its feelers, which have a thin membrane growing
between them, just as the feet of some birds are which have a membrane
of skin between their toes. And their other two feelers they let down
into the sea, instead of rudders; but when they see anything coming
towards them, then out of fear they draw in those feet, and fill
themselves with salt water, and so descend to the bottom as rapidly as
possible." But, in his treatise on Animals and Fishes, he says&mdash;"Of the
polypi there are two sorts; one, that which changes its colour, the
other the nautilus."</p>

<p>106. Now, on this nautilus there is an epigram quoted of Callimachus of
Cyrene, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I was a shell, O Venus Zephyritis,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br />
Now I'm the pious offering of Selena,<br />
The gentle nautilus. When balmy winds<br />
Breathe soft along the sea, I hold my course,<br />
Stretching my sails on their congenial yards.<br />
Should calm, the placid goddess, still the waves,<br />
I row myself along with nimble feet,<br />
So that my name suits rightly with my acts.<br />
Now have I fallen on the Iulian shore,<br />
To be a pleasant sport to Arsinoe.<br />
No more shall Halcyons' dew-besprinkled eggs,<br />

As formerly they did, since here I lie.<br />
But give to Cleinias's daughter worthy thanks;<br />
For she does shape her conduct honestly,<br />
And from &AElig;olian Smyrna doth she come.
</div>

<p>Posidippus also wrote this epigram on the same Venus which is
worshipped in Zephyrium:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Oh, all ye men who traffic on the streams,<br />
Or on the land who hold a safer way,
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 501]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE POLYPUS.</div>

<div class="topspace-1">
<div class="blockindent">

And she will on your pious voyage smile,<br />
And amid storms will for her votaries<br />
Smooth the vex'd surface of the wide-spread sea.
</div>
</div>

<p>Ion the tragedian also mentions the polypus, in his Ph&oelig;nix, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I hate the colour-changing polypus,<br />
Clinging with bloodless feelers to the rocks.
</div>

<p>107. Now the different species of polypus are these: the eledone,
the polypodine, the bolbotine, the osmylus; as both Aristotle and
Speusippus teach us. But, in his book on Animals and their Properties,
Aristotle says that the polypus, the osmylus, the eledone, the
cuttle-fish, and the squid, are all molluscous. Epicharmus, in his
Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A polypus, a cuttle-fish, and quickly-moving squid,<br />
A foul-smelling bolbitine, and chattering old woman.
</div>

<p>And Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The Carian and the Thasian polypi<br />
Are far the best; Corcyra too can breed<br />
Fish of large size and very numerous.
</div>

<p>But the Dorians spell the word with an <ins title="Greek: ô">ω</ins>, <ins title="Greek: pôlypous">πωλύπους</ins>;
as, for instance, Epicharmus. Simonides too has the expression, <ins title="Greek: pôlypon dizêmenos">πώλυπον διζήμενος</ins>.
But the Attics spell the word <ins title="Greek: polypous">πολύπους</ins>, with an <ins title="Greek: o">ο</ins>: and it is a cartilaginous fish;
for <ins title="Greek: chondrôdês">χονδρώδης</ins> and <ins title="Greek: selachôdês">σελαχώδης</ins> have the same meaning;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The polypodes and the dog-shark.
</div>

<p>Moreover, all the fish belonging to the species of the cuttle-fish are
called molluscous. But the whole tribe of . . . . . is cartilaginous.</p>

<p>108. There is also a fish called the pagurus; and it is mentioned by
Timocles or Xenarchus, in his Purple, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But I, as being a skilful fisherman,<br />
Have carefully devised all sorts of arts<br />
To catch those vile paguri, enemies<br />
To all the gods and all the little fishes.<br />
And shall I not without delay beguile<br />
An old buglossus? That would be well done.
</div>

<p>109. There is also the pelamys. Phrynichus mentions it in his Muses;
and Aristotle, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of
Animals, says the pelamydes and the tunnies breed in the Black Sea,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 502]</span>

but not anywhere else. Sophocles also mentions them, in his Shepherds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There, too, the foreign pelamys does winter,<br />
The stranger from the Hellespont. For she<br />
Doth come with many of her kind in summer<br />
To these cool waters of the Bosphorus.
</div>

<p>110. Then there is the perch. He also is mentioned by Diocles; and
Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things Resembling one
another, says that the perch, the canna, and the phycis are all nearly
alike. And Epicharmus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The comaris, the sea-dog, and the cestra<br />
And variegated perch.
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his treatise on the Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
At one time perch, and at another strophades,<br />
Which keep around the rocks. The phycis too,<br />
Th' alphestes, and the red-flesh'd scorpion.
</div>

<p>There is also the phycis. This also is mentioned by Epicharmus, in
his Hebe's Wedding; and by Speusippus, in the second book of his
treatise on Things Resembling one another; and by Numenius: all whose
testimonies are at hand. Aristotle, in his book upon Animals and their
Properties, says that the phycis is surrounded with prickles and
spotted. But the perch is marked with lines, and with bars running in
an oblique direction. And there is a proverb also, "The perch follows
the blacktail."</p>

<p>111. We have also the needle-fish. This also is mentioned by
Epicharmus, who says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The oxyrhynchi, and the needle-fish,<br />
And the hippuri.
</div>

<p>But Dorion, in his work on Fish, says&mdash;"The belone, which they also
call the needle-fish." Aristotle too, in the fifth book of his Parts
of Animals, calls this fish the belone. But, in his book on Animals
and their Properties, or else in his work on Fishes, he calls it the
needle-fish; and says that it has no teeth. And Speusippus calls it the
belone.</p>

<p>112. There is also the rhinè. Dorion, in his book on Fishes, says that
the rhinès are best at Smyrna; and that all the cartilaginous fish are
especially good in the gulf of Smyrna. And Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the far-famed Miletus does produce<br />
All cartilaginous fish in high perfection,
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 503]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="topspace-1">
<div class="blockindent">
But first of all one ought to take account<br />
Both of the rhina and leiobatus,<br />

Give me a roasted crocodile to eat,<br />
Fresh from the oven, a most dainty dish<br />
For all the children of Ionia.
</div>
</div>

<p>113. There is next the scarus, or char. Aristotle says that this fish
has serrated teeth, and is a solitary fish, and carnivorous; and that
it has a small mouth, and a tongue which does not adhere closely to the
mouth, and a triangular heart of a whitish colour and with three lobes;
and that its gall and spleen are black, and that of its gills one is
double and one single; and that it alone of all fish chews the cud. And
that it delights in seaweed for food, on which account the fishermen
use seaweed as a bait to catch it with. And it is in season in the
summer. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We fish for spari, and for scari too,<br />
Whose very dung may not be thrown away.
</div>

<p>But Seleucus of Tarsus, in his treatise on Fishing, says that the
scarus is the only fish which never sleeps; by reason of which it is
not easily caught, even by night. But this may be the case on account
of its timid nature. And Archestratus says, in his Gastronomy,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Seek now a scarus, fresh from Ephesus,<br />
And in the winter season eat a mullet<br />
Caught in the waves of sandy Teichioussa,<br />
A village of Miletus, near the Carians,<br />
The crooked-footed Carians.
</div>

<p>And in another part he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Wash and then roast the mighty scarus which<br />
Comes from the sea that laves Chalcedon's walls:<br />
That too is good which near Byzantium swims,<br />
With back as broad as a large oval shield.<br />
Take him and cook him whole as I shall tell you.<br />
Sprinkle him o'er with oil and grated cheese,<br />
Then place him in the oven hanging up,<br />
So as to escape the bottom, and then roast him,<br />
And sprinkle him with salt and cummin seed<br />
Well mix'd together; and again with oil,<br />
Pouring out of your hand the holy stream.
</div>

<p>Nicander of Thyatira says that there are two kinds of scari; and that
one is called the onias, and the other the &aelig;olus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 504]</span></p>

<p>114. Then there is the sparus. Icesius says that this is a more juicy
fish than the sprat, and more nutritious than most other fish. And
Epicharmus says, in his Hebe's Wedding,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Neptune then arrives himself<br />
<span class="linespace1">Laden with most beauteous nets</span><br />
In the boats of fair Ph&oelig;nicia,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Then we all do spari catch,</span><br />
And scari too, that sacred fish,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Whose very dung may not be thrown away.</span>
</div>

<p>And Numenius says, in his treatise on Fishing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sparus or the hycas fond of company.
</div>

<p>And Dorion mentions this fish, in his treatise on Fishes.</p>

<p>115. There is also the scorpion. Diocles, in the first book of his
treatise on Wholesome Things, addressed to Plistarchus, says&mdash;"Of fresh
fish, the following have drier meat: the scorpions, the sea-cuckoo,
the sea-sparrow, the sargi, and the rough-tail. But the mullet is
not so dry as these are; for all fish which keep near the rocks have
softer flesh." And Icesius says&mdash;"There are two kinds of scorpion;
one of which lives in the sea, and the other in marshes. And the
one which lives in the sea is red, but the other is rather black.
But the sea-mullet is superior to the other, both in taste and in
nutritious qualities. But the scorpions have purging qualities, are
easy of secretion, very juicy, and very nutritious; for they are a
cartilaginous fish." The scorpion brings forth its young twice a-year,
as Aristotle tells us, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals. But
Numenius says, in his treatise on Fishing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The phycides, the alphestes, and besides<br />
The red-flesh'd scorpion, and the blacktail quick,<br />
Which guides the perch all through the stormy sea.
</div>

<p>But that he is a fish which has the power of stinging, Aristotle tells
us, in his book about Fishes or Animals. And Epicharmus, in his Muses,
says that the scorpion is a variegated fish:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The variegated scorpion, the grayling,<br />
The fat and well-fed lizards.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 505]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>The scorpion is a solitary fish, and feeds on seaweed. But, in the
fifth book of his Parts of Animals, Aristotle speaks of scorpions and
scorpides in different places; but it is uncertain whether he means the
same fish; because we ourselves have often eaten the scorp&aelig;na and the
scorpion, and there is no
one who does not know that both their juice and their meat are quite
different. But Archestratus, that skilful cook, in his Golden Words,
tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When you're at Thasos buy a scorpion,<br />
But let him not be longer than one cubit;<br />
Avoid the larger sizes.
</div>

<p>116. Then there is the scombrus, or tunny, which is mentioned by this
name by Aristophanes, in his Gerytades. Icesius says that that species
of tunny called scombrus is smaller in size, but more nutritious, than
the species called colias; and also more juicy, though not more easily
digested. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, mentions them thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Sea-swallows, and mormyri, both of which<br />
Are larger than the coli&aelig; and the scombri,<br />
But less than those whose name is thynnides.
</div>

<p>117. The sargus is another fish. He (as Icesius tells us) is a fish of
very exciting and astringent properties, and more nutritious than the
melanurus, or blacktail. But Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, says
that the sargus is a very cunning fish as respects the catching him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The rich sea-blackbird, or the thrush who sports<br />
Beneath the waves; the sargus too who rushes<br />
Now here with sudden movement, and now there,<br />
The greatest enemy to the fisher's nets.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of
Animals, says that the sargus brings forth its young twice in the year;
once in the spring, and once in the autumn. And Epicharmus, in his
Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sargus, and the chalcis, and the . . .
</div>

<p>But he speaks of the sarginus, or sargus, as an excellent fish, in the
following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There the sarginus was, the melanurus,<br />
And the dear t&aelig;nia, thin but delicious.
</div>

<p>And in a similar manner Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, speaks,
calling them sargini and chalcides, on this very account. But the wise
Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now when the bright Orion's star doth set,<br />
And the fair mother of the vinous grape<br />
Doth shed her hair, then take a roasted sargus,<br />
Well sprinkled o'er with cheese, of mighty size,<br />
Smoking, and soften'd with sharp vinegar.<br />
For he is hard by nature. And remember<br />
This is the way all hard fish should be cook'd.<br />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</span></p>

But those whose meat is good and soft by nature,<br />
It is enough to sprinkle well with salt,<br />
And lightly to anoint with oil. For they<br />
Have virtue and delights within themselves.
</div>

<p>118. There is the salpe, too. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The aon, and the phagrus, and the pike,<br />
And the dung-eating, bloated, dirty salpe,<br />
Which still have a sweet flavour in the summer.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, says that the
salpe has young once a-year only, in the autumn; and that his skin is
covered with numerous red lines. Moreover, he has serrated teeth, and
is a solitary fish. And he says that it is stated by the fishermen that
he may be caught with a cucumber, being very fond of that kind of food.
And Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I always do account the fish call'd salpe<br />
A worthless fish. But it is least tasteless<br />
When the wheat ripens. And the choicest kinds<br />
Are caught at Mitylene.
</div>

<p>And Pancrates, in his Works of the Sea, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is the salpe too, of the same size,<br />
Which the seafaring fishermen do call<br />
The ox, because he grinds within his teeth<br />
The stout seaweed with which he fills his belly.
</div>

<p>He also is a spotted or variegated fish; on which account his friends
used to nickname Mnaseas the Locrian (or, as some call him, the
Colophonian),&mdash;the man who wrote the poem called The Sports,&mdash;Salpe,
on account of the variety of things in his collection. But Nymphodorus
the Syracusan, in his Voyage round Asia, says that it was a Lesbian
woman, named Salpe, who wrote the book called The Sports. But Alcimus,
in his Affairs of Sicily, says that in Messene, in Sicily, there was a
man named Botrys, who was the author of some "Sports" very like those
which are attributed to Salpe. But Archippus uses the word in the
masculine form, <i>Salpes</i>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The ceryx shouted out,<br />
The salpes trumpeted and fetch'd seven obols.
</div>

<p>And there is a similar fish produced in the Red Sea, which is called
the stromateus; and it has gold-coloured lines running along the whole
of his body, as Philo tells us, in his book on Mines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 507]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>119. There is also the synodon and the synagris. They also are
mentioned by Epicharmus, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Synagrides, and mazi, and the synodons,<br />
With red spots variegated.
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, writes the word with an
<ins title="Greek: u">υ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: synodous">συνόδους</ins>; and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then the white synodon, and boax, and triccus.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Fish with these baits then, if you wish to eat<br />
The mighty synodon, or diving horsetail.
</div>

<p>But Dorion writes the word <ins title="Greek: sinodous">σινόδους</ins>, with an <ins title="Greek: i">ι</ins>; and
so does Archestratus, in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But try to catch a well-fed sinodon,<br />
And you will find the best in narrow straits.<br />
All this advice to Cyrus I have given,<br />
And now to you, Cle&aelig;nus, I impart it.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes says, in his Archistrata,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But who would eat an eel, or sinodon's head.
</div>

<p>120. There is also the saurus, or lizard. Alexis mentions this fish, in
his Leuce. It is a cook who is speaking:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Do you know how you ought to dress a lizard?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> I shall, when you have taught me.</span><br />
<span class="linespace13"><i>A.</i> First of all</span><br />
Take off the gills, then wash him, then cut off<br />
The spines all round, and split him open neatly;<br />
Then when you've laid him flat, anoint him well<br />
And thoroughly with assaf&oelig;tida;<br />
Sprinkle him then with cheese, and salt, and marjoram.
</div>

<p>And Ephippus, in his Cydon, gives a list of many other fishes, and
among them he mentions the lizard, in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Slices of tunny, and of glanis,<br />
Of shark, and rhinè, and of conger,<br />
Cephalus, perch, and lizard too,<br />
And phycis, brinchus, also mullet,<br />
Sea-cuckoo, phagrus, myllus, sparus,<br />
Lebias, &aelig;olias, and sea-swallow,<br />
Thritta, and squid, and cuttle-fish,<br />
Sea-sparrow, and drac&aelig;nides.<br />
The polypus, the squid, and orphus,<br />
The tench, th' anchovy, and the cestres,<br />
And last of all the needle-fish.
</div>

<p>And Innesimachus, in his Horse-breeder, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Of fish with teeth serrated, you may eat<br />
The grim torpedo, the sea-frog, the perch,<br />
The lizard, and the trichias, and the phycis,<br />
The brinchus, and the mullet, and sea-cuckoo.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 508]</span></p>

<p>There is also the scepinus; and this fish is mentioned by Dorion,
in his treatise on Fish; and he says that it is also called the
attageinus, or sea-woodcock.</p>

<p>121. There is also the sci&aelig;na. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
&AElig;oli&aelig; were there, and plotes too,<br />
And cynoglossi and sciathides.
</div>

<p>But Numenius calls this fish the Sciadeus, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Use then this bait, and you perhaps may catch,<br />
If such your wish, a mighty synodon,<br />
Or the quick leaping hippurus, or the phagrus<br />
Proud with his high-raised crest, or in a shoal<br />
Of trusty comrades, the fresh sciadeus.
</div>

<p>There is also the syagris; and this fish is mentioned by Epicharmus, in
his Hebe's Wedding, and also in his Earth and Sea.</p>

<p>122. Then there is the sphur&aelig;na, or hammer-fish; and these fish,
Icesius says, are more nutritious than the congers, but very unpleasant
and unpalatable to the taste; and, as to their juicy qualities, they
are tolerable. But Dorion says&mdash;"The sphur&aelig;na, which they call the
cestra." And Epicharmus, in his Muses, having named the cestra, does
not after that mention the sphur&aelig;na, thinking them the same fish&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The chalcides, the sea-dog, and the cestra,<br />
And perch with variegated back.
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his Male Farces, says&mdash;"The cestr&aelig;, which eat the
botis." But Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things
which resemble one another, puts down the cestra, the needle-fish, and
the sea-lizard as very nearly like one another. And the Attic writers
in general call the sphur&aelig;na the cestra, and do not so often use the
name of sphur&aelig;na. Accordingly, Strattis, in his Macedonians, when some
Athenian asks the question, as being ignorant of the name, and saying,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But what is the sphur&aelig;na?
</div>

<p>The other replies,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You, O Athenians, do call it the cestra.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Euthydicus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> The sphur&aelig;na is a common fish.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> You should say cestra, in strict Attic Greek.</span>
</div>

<p>And Nicophon, in his Pandora, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cestra and the pike.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 509]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cestra and the variegated perch.
</div>

<p>123. The cuttle-fish is often mentioned. Aristophanes says, in his
Danaides,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And when I have the cuttle-fish and polypus.
</div>

<p>And the penultima of this word has the acute accent, like that in the
word <ins title="Greek: aitia">αἰτία</ins>, as Philemon tells us; like these words,
<ins title="Greek: paidia">παιδία</ins>, <ins title="Greek: tainia">ταινία</ins>, <ins title="Greek: aitia">οἰκία</ins>. But Aristotle says that the
cuttle-fish has eight feet, of which the two lowest are the largest;
and that it has two proboscises, and between them it has its eyes
and mouth placed. And it has two teeth, one above and one below; and
what is called a shell on its back. And the ink is contained in what
is called the mutis, which answers to the liver; and it lies near
its mouth, being something like a bladder. Its belly is wide and
smooth, like the paunch of an ox. And the little cuttle-fish feed on
small fish, extending their proboscises like fishermen's lines, and
catching their prey with them. It is said, too, that when a storm
comes, they seize hold of the rocks with their proboscises, as if they
were anchors, and so fix themselves firm. And when the cuttle-fish is
pursued, it discharges its ink, and is hidden in it, making it appear
as if it were flying forwards. And it is also said, that when the
female is struck by a harpoon, the male fish come to its assistance,
dragging it on; but if the male fish be taken, the female fish flees
away. But the cuttle-fish does not live more than a year, as neither
does the polypus. But, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals,
Aristotle says&mdash;"The cuttle-fish and the squids swim together, being
united together at the mouths, and also touching one another with their
feelers, so as to join in that manner; and they also join proboscis
to proboscis. But of all the molluscous fish, the cuttle-fish is the
earliest in the spring to bring forth its young; and they do not bring
forth at every season. But they go with young fifteen days; and when
they lay their eggs, the male follows the female, and breathes upon the
eggs and makes them firm. And they move in pairs; and the male is more
variegated than the female, and blacker on the back."</p>

<p>124. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The polypus, likewise the cuttle-fish,<br />
And the swift-moving squid.
</div>

<p>And we must also take notice of this, with reference to Speusippus,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 510]</span>

who says that the cuttle-fish and the squid are the same fish. But when
Hipponax, in his Iambics, uses the words <ins title="Greek: sêpiês hyposphagm">σηπίης ὑπόσφαγμα</ins>,
the interpreters have explained the expression as meaning "the ink
of the cuttle-fish." But the word <ins title="Greek: hyposphagma">ὑπόσφαγμα</ins> is, properly
speaking, equivalent to <ins title="Greek: hypotrimma">ὑπότριμμα</ins>, a dish compounded of
various ingredients, as Erasistratus tells us, in his Cookery Book. And
he writes as follows&mdash;"But <ins title="Greek: hyposphagma">ὑπόσφαγμα</ins> is made with roast meat
and blood stirred up and compounded with cheese, and salt, and cummin,
and assaf&oelig;tida; but the meat may also be boiled." And Glaucus the
Locrian, in his Cookery Book, writes as follows&mdash;"<ins title="Greek: Hyposphagma">Ὑπόσφαγμα</ins>
is blood boiled, and assaf&oelig;tida, and boiled lees of wine; or sometimes
honey and vinegar, and milk and cheese, and sweet-smelling herbs are
shred and mixed together in it." And Archestratus, that man of the most
varied learning, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cuttle-fish of Abdera and the middle of Maronea.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Thesmophoriazus&aelig;, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Has any fish or cuttle-fish been bought?
</div>

<p>And in the Danaides he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Osmulia, m&oelig;nidea, and cuttle-fish.
</div>

<p>Theopompus, in his Aphrodite, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
. . . But eat, my friend,<br />
This cuttle-fish, and this small polypus.
</div>

<p>But concerning the boiling of the small polypus, Alexis, in his Wicked
Woman, introduces a cook speaking as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now these three cuttle-fish I have just bought<br />
For one small drachma. And when I've cut off<br />
Their feelers and their fins, I then shall boil them.<br />
And cutting up the main part of their meat<br />
Into small dice, and rubbing in some salt,<br />
After the guests already are sat down,<br />
I then shall put them in the frying-pan,<br />
And serve up hot towards the end of supper.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 511]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>125. The next fish is the mullet; and <ins title="Greek: triglê">τρίγλη</ins> is like <ins title="Greek: kichlê">κίχλη</ins>,
ending in <ins title="Greek: ê">η</ins>. For the feminine nouns which end in
<ins title="Greek: la">λα</ins> require another <ins title="Greek: l">λ</ins> before the <ins title="Greek: la">λα</ins>; as
<ins title="Greek: skylla">σκύλλα</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Telesilla">Τελέσιλλα</ins>. But all the words which have
<ins title="Greek: g">γ</ins> united to <ins title="Greek: l">λ</ins> end in <ins title="Greek: ê">η</ins>; as
<ins title="Greek: trôglê">τρώγλη</ins>, <ins title="Greek: aiglê">αἴγλη</ins>, <ins title="Greek: zeuglê">ζεύγλη</ins>. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of
his Parts of Animals, says that the mullet brings forth three times
in the year; and states that the fishermen have adopted this opinion
from the spawn being seen three times a-year in certain localities. And
perhaps it is from the word <ins title="Greek: tris">τρὶς</ins> (three times) that it has its
name; just as the fish called <ins title="Greek: amia">ἀμία</ins> has its name

from its being a fish which does not go about by itself, but in shoals
(<ins title="Greek: hama">ἄμα</ins>). And the <ins title="Greek: skaros">σκάροϛ</ins> is so called from <ins title="Greek: skairô">σκαίρω</ins> (to leap); as also is the
<ins title="Greek: karis">καρίς</ins>. And the <ins title="Greek: aphyê">ἀφύη</ins> is so named as being <ins title="Greek: aphyês">ἀφυὴϛ</ins>, which is equivalent to
<ins title="Greek: dysphyês">δυσφυὴς</ins>, that is to say, slowly propagated. Then <ins title="Greek: thynnos">θύννος</ins>
has its name from <ins title="Greek: thyô">θύω</ins> (to rush), because it is an
impetuous fish, from being driven about by its fly in the head at the
time of the rising of the Dog-star. But it is a fish with serrated
teeth, gregarious, and spotted all over, and also carnivorous: and
when it has had young three times it becomes barren; for some little
worms are engendered in its womb, which devour the young as soon as
they are conceived. And from the actual facts, Epicharmus calls them
hump-backed, in his Hebe's Wedding, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He brought the hump-back'd mullet too,<br />
And the ungrateful b&aelig;ones.
</div>

<p>But Sophron, in his Male Farces, speaks of a fish which he calls
<ins title="Greek: trigolê">τρίγολη</ins>, saying,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The trigola which cuts the navel string.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The trigola which loves calm weather.
</div>

<p>And in his play called P&aelig;dica he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
. . . . . trigola . . . .
</div>

<p>But, in his Affairs of Women, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The bearded mullet (<ins title="Greek: triglê">τρίγλη</ins>).
</div>

<p>But Diocles, in his books addressed to Plistarchus, says that
the mullet is a fish of hard flesh; and Speusippus says that the
sea-cuckoo, the sea-swallow, and the mullet are all alike; on which
account Tryphon says, in his treatise on Animals, that some people
think that the trigola is the sea-cuckoo, from its likeness to it, and
from the dryness of its hind-quarters; which Sophron indicates, when he
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The fat mullets and the hinder parts of the trigola.
</div>

<p>126. But Plato, in his Phaon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The mullet is not wholesome for the nerves,<br />
For it is sacred to the chaste Diana,<br />
And all excitement hates.
</div>

<p>But the mullet is attributed to Hecate as her fish, on account of
the common derivation of their names; for Hecate is called
<ins title="Greek: trioditis">τριοδῖτις</ins>, as presiding over places where three roads meet, and
<ins title="Greek: triglênos">τρίγληνος</ins>, as having three eyes; and also they provide her a
banquet on the thirtieth day of each month (<ins title="Greek: tais triakasi">ταῖς τριακάσι</ins>).

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 512]</span>

And, on similar principles, they assign to Apollo the fish <ins title="Greek: kitharos">κίθαρος</ins>,
from <ins title="Greek: kithara">κιθάρα</ins> (the harp); and the <ins title="Greek: boax">βόαξ</ins>
to Mercury, from <ins title="Greek: boaô">βοάω</ins> (to speak); and the <ins title="Greek: kittos">κιττὸς</ins>
to Bacchus, from <ins title="Greek: kissos">κισσὸς</ins> (ivy); and the <ins title="Greek: phalaris">φάλαρις</ins> to
Venus, as Aristophanes in his Birds says, from the similarity of its
name to the word <ins title="Greek: phalaris">φαλλός</ins>. And so the bird called the <ins title="Greek: nêssa">νῆσσα</ins> (or duck), they
call Neptune's bird; and the sea production
which we call <ins title="Greek: aphya">ἀφυὰ</ins>, and others <ins title="Greek: aphrya">ἀφρύα</ins>, and which
is more generally called <ins title="Greek: aphros">ἀφρὸς</ins> (foam), they also give to
him; though they say that this also is very dear to Venus, because she
herself was born of foam. But Apollodorus, in his books concerning
the Gods, says that the mullet is sacrificed to Hecate on account
of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is <ins title="Greek: trimorphos">τρίμορφος</ins>,
of a triple form. But Melanthus, in his treatise on the
Eleusinian Mysteries, says that both the <ins title="Greek: triglê">τρίγλη</ins> and the <ins title="Greek: mainis">μαινὶς</ins> (or sprat),
are sacred to Hecate, because Hecate is
also a goddess of the sea. But Hegesander the Delphian says that the
mullet is accustomed to be carried about in the Artemisia, because it
is accustomed diligently to hunt out and destroy the sea-hares, which
are poisonous animals; on which account, as it does this to the great
benefit of mankind, the mullet as a huntress is considered sacred to
the goddess who is also a huntress. And Sophron has called the mullet
"bearded," because those which have beards are better flavoured than
those which have not. And there is a place at Athens called <ins title="Greek: Trigla">Τρίγλα</ins>,
and there there is a shrine to <ins title="Greek: Hekatê Triglanthinê">Ἑκάτη Τριγλανθίνη</ins>;
on which account Chariclides, in his Chain, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O mistress Hecate, Trioditis,<br />
With three forms (<ins title="Greek: trimorphe">τρίμορφε</ins>) and three faces (<ins title="Greek: triprosôpe">τριπρόσωπε</ins>),<br />
Propitiated with mullets (<ins title="Greek: triglais">τρίγλαις</ins>).
</div>

<p>127. And if the mullet, while alive, be choked with wine, and
then a man drinks the wine, he will no longer be able to indulge
in the pleasures of Venus, as Terpsicles tells us in his book on
Amatory Pleasures. And if a woman drinks this same wine, she never
becomes pregnant. Birds, too, are affected in the same manner. But
Archestratus, that very learned man, after he has praised the Milesian
mullet which are found at Teichius, proceeds to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If you at Thasos are, then buy a mullet;<br />
You ne'er will get a worse, unless indeed<br />
You go to Tius; but even those are fair:<br />
But at Erythr&aelig; they are caught in shore<br />
And are most excellent.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 513]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>And Cratinus, in his Trophonius, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And do not eat a red-flesh'd mullet hard,<br />
Brought from &AElig;xona; nor of any turtle,<br />
Or mighty melanurus from those seas.
</div>

<p>But Nausicrates, the comic poet, praises the mullets from &AElig;xona, in his
Captains of Ships, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Those yellow-fleshed fish, which the high wave</span><br />
That beats &AElig;xona brings towards the shore,<br />
The best of fish; with which we venerate<br />
The light-bestowing daughter of great Jove;<br />
When sailors offer gifts of feasts to heaven.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> You mean the mullet.</span>
</div>

<p>128. There is, too, the t&aelig;nia; and this is mentioned by Epicharmus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The most belovèd t&aelig;nia, which are thin,<br />
But highly flavour'd, and need little fire.
</div>

<p>And Mith&aelig;cus, in his Cookery Book, says&mdash;"Having taken out the entrails
of the t&aelig;nia, and cut off its head, and washed it, and having cut it
into slices, sprinkle over it cheese and oil." But this fish is found
in the greatest number and in the finest condition off Canopus, which
is near Alexandria; and also off Seleucia, which is close to Antioch.
But when Eupolis, in his Prospaltii, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
His mother was a Thracian woman,<br />
A seller of t&aelig;ni&aelig;;
</div>

<p>he then means by the word <ins title="Greek: tainia">ταινία</ins>, not the fish, but those
pieces of woven work and girdles with which women bind their waists.</p>

<p>129. Another fish is the trachurus, or rough-tail. Diocles mentions
this as a dry fish. And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The aconia and the wagtail too,<br />
And the . . . . trachurus.
</div>

<p>There is also the taulopias. Concerning this fish, Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When it is summer buy a good-sized head<br />
Of fresh taulopias, just when Phaethon<br />
Is driving his last course. Dress it with speed,<br />
Serve it up hot, and some good seasoning with it,<br />
Then take its entrails, spit and roast them too.
</div>

<p>130. There is also the <ins title="Greek: teuthis">τευθὶς</ins>, [which is a kind of
cuttle-fish, different from the <ins title="Greek: sêpia">σηπίς</ins>.] Aristotle says that
this also is a gregarious fish, and that it has a great many things

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</span>

in common with the sepia; such as the same number of feet, and the two
proboscises: but of this kind the lower feet are the smaller, and the
upper feet the larger; and of the proboscises, that on the right side
is the thickest: and the whole body is delicate, and of a more oblong
shape than the sepia. And the teuthis also has ink in its mutis, which,
however, is not black, but of a pale colour. And its shell is very
small, and cartilaginous.</p>

<p>There is also the teuthus; and the only difference between the teuthus
and the teuthis is in size: and the teuthus is of the size of three
spans; and it is of a reddish colour. And of its two teeth, the lower
one is the smallest, and the upper one is the largest; and both of them
are black, and like a hawk's beak. And when it is slit open, it has a
paunch like a pig's paunch. Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts
of Animals, says that both the teuthus and the sepia are short-lived
fish. And Archestratus, who travelled and sailed over the whole earth,
for the sake of gratifying his greedy appetite, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The best of all the teuthides are those<br />
Caught near Pierian Dium, near the stream<br />
Of Baphyras. And in Ambracia's port<br />
You will see mighty shoals of this same fish.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Eretrian, introduces a cook speaking in this way&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Teuthides, thornbacks, rays, and fat<br />
Anchovies, lumps of meat, and paunches too.<br />
I took the teuthides, cut off their fins,<br />
Adding a little fat; I then did sprinkle<br />
Some thin shred herbs o'er all for seasoning.
</div>

<p>There is also a sort of cake or confectionary called <ins title="Greek: teuthis">τευθὶς</ins>,
which is mentioned by Iatrocles, in his book on the Art of making
Bread, as Pamphilus quotes.</p>

<p>131. Then there is the sea-pig. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were hy&aelig;nides, buglossi,<br />
There was the harp-fish too in numbers.
</div>

<p>And he also calls them not only ὑαινίδες, but also ὔες in the following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were too chalcides and sea-pigs (ὔες),<br />
And sea-hawks, and the fat sea-dog.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 515]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>Unless, indeed, when he uses the word <ins title="Greek: hys">ὗς</ins> here, he means the
same animal which is also called <ins title="Greek: os">κάπρος</ins>, the sea-boar. But
Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, enumerates plainly enough some sort of
ὕαινα or plaice, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cantharis, hy&aelig;na, and the mullet.
</div>

<p>And Dionysius, in his Cookery Book, also speaks of the hy&aelig;na or plaice.
And Archestratus, that prince of cooks and epicures says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
At &AElig;nus or at Potus buy the sea-pig,<br />
Which some men call the digger of the sand,<br />
Then boil his head, adding no seasoning,<br />
But only water, stirring it full often,<br />
And add some pounded hyssop; if you want<br />
Anything more, pour on some pungent vinegar;<br />
Steep it in that, then eat it with such haste<br />
As if your object were to choke yourself.<br />
But roast its neck, and all its other parts.
</div>

<p>And perhaps it is the sea-pig which Numenius, in his Art of Fishing,
calls the psamathis, or sand-fish, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Sometimes the fierce carcharias, and sometimes<br />
The psamathis, delighting in the surf.
</div>

<p>132. Then there is the hyces. Callimachus, in his epigrams, calls the
hyces the sacred fish, in these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And he does deem the sacred hyces god.
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The spar, or the gregarious hyces;<br />
Or phagrus, ever wand'ring near the rocks.
</div>

<p>And Tim&aelig;us, in the thirteenth book of his Histories, speaking of the
town in Sicily, (I mean the town of Hyccara,) says that this town
derived its name from the circumstance of the first man who arrived at
the place finding abundance of the fish called hyces, and those too in
a breeding condition; and they, taking this for an omen, called the
place Hyccarus. But Zenodotus says that the Cyren&aelig;ans call the hyces
the erythrinus. But Hermippus of Smyrna, in his essay on Hipponax, when
he speaks of the hyces, means the iulis; and says that it is very hard
to catch; on which account Philetas says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Nor was the hyces the last fish who fled.
</div>

<p>133. There is also the phagrus. Speusippus, in the second book of his
Things resembling one another, says that the phagrus, the erythrinus,
and the hepatus, are very much alike. And Numenius also has mentioned

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 516]</span>

it in the lines which have been quoted not long ago. But Aristotle says
that he is a carnivorous and solitary fish; and that he has a heart
of a triangular shape, and that he is in season in the spring. And
Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, speaks of the</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Aones, and the phagri, and the pikes.
</div>

<p>And Metagenes also mentions them in his Thurio-Pers&aelig;. And Ameipsias
says in his Connus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A food for orphi and selachia,<br />
And for the greedy phagri.
</div>

<p>And Icesius says&mdash;"The phagrus, and the chromis, and the anthias, and
the acharnanes, and the orphi, and the synodons, and the synagrides,
are all very nearly akin to one another; for they are sweet and
astringent, and nutritious, but in the same proportion they are hard
of digestion. And those of them, which are fleshy, and which are caught
nearer land, are the most nutritious, and those also which have the
least fat." But Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
'Tis when the dogstar rises in the sky<br />
That you should eat the phagrus; specially<br />
If you in Delos or Eretria are,<br />
Or other favouring harbours of the sea;<br />
But, if you can, purchase his head alone,<br />
And tail; and bring no more within your doors.
</div>

<p>Strattis also mentions the phagrus in his Lemnomeda&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Eating a number of large phagri.
</div>

<p>And in his Philoctetes he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then, going to the market, they will buy<br />
A great abundance of large phagri, and<br />
Slices of tender round Copaic eel.
</div>

<p>There is also a kind of stone called the phagrus. For the whetstone is
called so among the Cretans, as Simmias testifies.</p>

<p>134. There is also the channa. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The channa, with large mouth, and then the cod,<br />
With deep and spacious belly.
</div>

<p>Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The channas and the eel, and pitinus,<br />
Who only roams by night.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 517]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>Dorion also mentions him in his treatise on Fishes. But Aristotle, in
his book on Animals, calls the channa a fish
variegated with red and black; and he calls it also <ins title="Greek: poikilogrammos">ποικιλόγραμμος</ins>,
because it is marked with black lines.</p>

<p>135. There is the chromis; this also is spoken of by Epicharmus, who
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is the sword-fish and the chromias,<br />
Who, in the spring, as Ananius says,<br />
Is of all fish the daintiest.
</div>

<p>And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The hyces, or the beautiful callicthys,<br />
Or else the chromis, and sometimes the orphus.
</div>

<p>And Archestratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You may catch noble chromises in Pella,<br />
And they are fat when it is midsummer;<br />
And in Ambracia likewise they abound.
</div>

<p>136. There is also the chrysophrys. Archippus says in his Fishes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The chrysophrys, sacred to Cytherean Venus.
</div>

<p>And Icesius says that these fish are the best of all fish in sweetness,
and also in delicacy of flavour in other respects. They are also most
nutritious. They produce their young, as Aristotle says, in a manner
similar to the cestres, wherever there are flowing rivers. Epicharmus
mentions them in his Muses; and Dorion also, in his book on Fishes. And
Eupolis, in his Flatterers, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I spent a hundred drachmas upon fish,<br />
And only got eight pike, and twelve chrysophryes.
</div>

<p>But the wise Archestratus, in his Suggestions, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pass not the chrysophrys from Ephesus<br />
Unheeded by; which the Ephesians call<br />
The ioniscus. Take him eagerly,<br />
The produce of the venerable Selinus;<br />
Wash him, and roast him whole, and serve him up,<br />
Though he be ten full cubits long.
</div>

<p>137. There is a fish, too, called the chalcis; and others which
resemble it, namely, the thrissa, the trichis, and the eritimus.
Icesius says, the fish called the chalcis, and the sea-goat, and the
needle-fish, and the thrissa, are like chaff, destitute alike of fat
and of juice. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The chalcides, the sea-pig too,<br />
The sea-hawk, and the fat sea-dog.
</div>

<p>But Dorion calls it the chalcidice. And Numenius says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But you would thus harpoon, in the same way,<br />
That chalcis and the little tiny sprat.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 518]</span></p>

<p>But the <ins title="Greek: chalkeus">χαλκεὺς</ins> is different from the <ins title="Greek: chalkis">χαλκὶς</ins>; and
the <ins title="Greek: chalkeus">χαλκεὺς</ins> is mentioned by Heraclides, in his Cookery Book;
and by Euthydemus, in his book on Cured Fish, who says that they are
bred in the country of the Cyzicenes, being a round and circular fish.</p>

<p>But the thrissa is mentioned by Aristotle in his book on Animals
and Fishes, in these words&mdash;"The following are stationary fish: the
thrissa, the encrasicholus, the membras anchovy, the coracinus, the
erythrinus, and the trichis." And Eupolis mentions the trichis in his
Flatterers;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He was a stingy man, who once in his life<br />
Before the war did buy some trichides;<br />
But in the Samian war, a ha'p'orth of meat.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Knights, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If trichides were to be a penny a hundred.
</div>

<p>But Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, speaks also of the river
Thrissa; and calls the trichis trichias. Nicochares, in his Lemnian
Women, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The trichias, and the premas tunny too,<br />
Placed in enormous quantities for supper.
</div>

<p>(But there was a kind of tunny which they used to call premnas. Plato,
in his Europa, has these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He once, when fishing, saw one of such size<br />
A man could scarcely carry it, in a shoal<br />
Of premnades, and then he let it go,<br />
Because it was a boax.)
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, calls it
a trichias also, but in the book which is entitled Ζωϊκὸν,
he calls it trichis. And it is said that this fish is delighted with
dancing and singing, and that when it hears music it leaps up out of
the sea.</p>

<p>Dorion also mentions the eritimi, saying, that they are much the
same as the chalcides, and that they are very nice in forced meat.
And Ep&aelig;netus, in his book upon Fishes, says&mdash;"The sea-weasel; the
smaris, which some call the dog's-bed; the chalcides, which they
also call sardini; the eritimi, the sea-hawk, and the sea-swallow."
And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, calls them
sardines. And Callimachus, in his Names used by different Nations,
writes thus&mdash;"The encrasicholus, the eritimus, are names used by the
Chalcedonians; the trichidia, the chalcis, the ictar, the
atherina." And in another part, giving a list of the names of fishes,
he says&mdash;"The oz&aelig;na, the osmylnion, are names used by the Thurians;
the iopes, the eritimi, are names used by the Athenians." And Nicander
mentions the iopes in his B&oelig;otian,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 519]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
But as when round a shoal of newly born<br />
Iopes, phagri, or fierce scopes roam,<br />
Or the large orphus.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Ships of Burden, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O wretched fish, the first of trichides<br />
To be immersed in pickle.
</div>

<p>For they used to steep in pickle all the fish which were proper to be
dressed on the coals. And they called pickle, Thasian brine; as also
the same poet says in his Wasps,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For before that it twice drank in the brine.
</div>

<p>138. There is also a fish called the thratta. And since we have brought
the discussion to this point, and have also discussed the thrissa; let
us now examine what the thratt&aelig; are, which are mentioned by Archippus,
in his play called the Fishes. For in that play, in the treaty between
the Fishes and the Athenians, he introduces the following sentences&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And it is agreed on further<br />
That both the high contracting parties<br />
Shall restore all they now do hold<br />
Of each other's property.<br />
We shall give up thus the Thratt&aelig;,<br />
And the flute-playing Atherina,<br />
And Thyrsus's daughter Sepia,<br />
And the mullet, and Euclides,<br />
Who was archon t'other day,<br />
And the coraciontes too,<br />
Who from Anagyrus come;<br />
And the offspring of the tench,<br />
Who swims round sacred Salamis;<br />
And the frog who's seated near,<br />
From the marshes of Oreum.
</div>

<p>Now in these lines, perhaps a man may ask what sort of thratt&aelig; among
the fishes are meant here, which the fish agree to give up to the men.
And since I have got some private things written out on this subject,
I will now recite to you that portion of them which bears most on the
subject.</p>

<p>The thratta, then, is really a genuine sea-fish; and Mnesimachus, in
his Horse-breeder, mentions it; and Mnesimachus is a poet of the middle
comedy. And he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 520]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
The mullet, and the lebias, and the sparus,<br />
The bright &aelig;olias, and the thratta too,<br />
The sea-swallow, the caris, and the cuttle-fish.
</div>

<p>But Dorotheus of Ascalon, in the hundred and eighth book of his
Collection of Words, writes this name θέττα, either because
he fell in with a copy of the drama with an incorrect text, or because,
as he himself was unused to the word, he altered it so before he
published it. But the name thetta does absolutely never occur in any
Attic writer whatever. But that they were used to call a sea-fish by
the name of thratta, that Anaxandrides establishes, speaking in this
manner in his play called Lycurgus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And sporting with the little coracini,<br />
With little perches, and the little thratt&aelig;.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes says in his Etrurian&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> He is of the Hal&aelig;a borough. This is all</span><br />
That now is left me, to be abused unjustly.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Why so?</span><br />
<span class="linespace3"><i>A.</i> He will (you'll see) bestow on me</span><br />
Some thratta, or sea-sparrow, or some lamprey,<br />
Or some enormous other marine evil.
</div>

<p>139. We come now to the sea-sparrow. Diocles enumerates this fish among
the drier kinds. But Speusippus, in the second book of his Things
resembling one another, says that the sea-sparrow and the buglossus
and the t&aelig;nia are very much alike. But Aristotle, in the fifth book
of his Parts of Animals, writes&mdash;"And in the same manner the greater
number of the small fish have young once a-year; such as those which
are called chyti, which are surrounded by a net, namely, the chromis,
the sea-sparrow, the tunny, the pelamys, the cestreus, the chalcis,
and others of the same sort." And in his treatise on Animals he
says&mdash;"These fish are cartilaginous, the sea-cow, the turtle, the
torpedo, the ray, the sea-frog, the buglossa, the sea-sparrow, the
mussel." But Dorion, in his book on Fishes, says&mdash;"But of flat fish
there is the buglossus, the sea-sparrow, the escharus, which they also
call the coris." The buglossi are mentioned also by Epicharmus in his
Hebe's Wedding&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Hy&aelig;nides, buglossi, and a citharus.
</div>

<p>And Lynceus the Samian, in his Letters, says that the finest
sea-sparrows are procured near Eleusis, in Attica. And Archestratus
says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 521‒522]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Remember then to get a fine sea-sparrow,<br />
And a rough-skinn'd buglossus, near the port<br />
Of sacred Chalcis
</div>

<p>But the Romans call the sea-sparrow rhombus; which, however, is a Greek
name. And Nausicrates, in his Sea Captains, having first mentioned the
sea-grayling, proceeds in this manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Those yellow-fleshed fish, which the high wave</span><br />
That beats &AElig;xona brings towards the shore,<br />
The best of fish; with which we venerate<br />
The light-bestowing daughter of great Jove;<br />
When sailors offer gifts of feasts to heaven.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> You mean the mullet, with its milky colour,</span><br />
Which the Sicilian multitude calls rhombus.
</div>

<p>140. So now, having given you, O Timocrates, the whole of the
conversation which took place among the Deipnosophists on the subject
of fish, we may conclude our book here; and unless you want some other
kind of food, we will end by setting before you what Eubulus has said
in his Laced&aelig;monians, or Leda;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Besides all this you now shall have<br />
A slice of tunny, a slice of pork,<br />
Some paunch of kid, some liver of goat,<br />
Some ram, the entrails of an ox,<br />
A lamb's head, and a kid's intestines;<br />
The belly of a hare, a pudding,<br />
Some tripe, black-puddings, and a sausage.
</div>

<p>Being sated, therefore, with all this, let us now take due care of
our bodies, in order to be able to feed comfortably on what is coming
next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>1. Polybius the Megalopolitan, speaking of the great happiness which
exists in Lusitania (and that is a district of Iberia, which the Romans
now call Spania), O most excellent Timocrates, in the thirty-fourth
book of his Histories, says that in that country, on account of the
excellent temperature of the air, both animals and men are exceedingly
prolific; and the fruits, too, in that country never degenerate. "For
there are roses there, and white violets, and asparagus, and other
flowers and fruits like them, which last nine months in the year; and
as for sea-fish, both in abundance, and in excellence, and in beauty,
it is very superior to that produced in our seas. And a siclus (this is
equal to a medimnus) of barley costs only a drachma; and one of wheat
costs nine Alexandrian obols; and a measure of wine costs a drachma;
and a moderate-sized kid costs an obol, and so does a hare. And of
lambs, the price is three or four obols; and a fat pig, weighing a
hundred min&aelig;, costs five drachm&aelig;; and a sheep costs two. And a talent
weight of figs costs three obols; and a calf costs five drachm&aelig;; and a
draught-ox ten. And the meat of wild animals is scarcely ever valued
at any price at all; but people throw that in to purchasers into
the bargain, or as a present." But to us, whenever we sup with our
excellent friend Laurentius, he makes Rome another Lusitania,&mdash;filling
us with every sort of good thing every day, receiving us in a most
princely manner with the greatest liberality, while we bring nothing
from home as our contribution, except our arguments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 524]</span></p>

<p>2. Now, as a long discussion had taken place about fish, it was plain
that Cynulcus was annoyed at it; and so the excellent Democritus,
anticipating him, said&mdash;But, O you men fish, as Archippus says, you
have omitted (for I too must throw in a little contribution of my
own) those which are called fossil fishes, which are produced at
Heraclea, and near Tium, in Pontus, which is a colony of the Milesians,
though Theophrastus gives us an account of them. And this very same
philosopher has also told us about those that are congealed in ice the
whole winter, so that they have no feeling whatever, and make not the
slightest motion, until they are put into the saucepans and boiled. And
these fish have this especial peculiarity, which also belongs in some
degree to the fish which are called fossil fish in Paphlagonia. For it
is said that ditches are dug in those places to an exceeding depth,
where no overflow of rivers ever reaches, nor of any other waters
whatever; and yet in those ditches there are found living fishes.</p>

<p>3. But Mnaseas of Patra, in his Periplus, says that the fish in the
river Clitor are not dumb; though Aristotle has stated in writing that
the only fishes which have any voice are the scarus and the river-hog.
And Philostephanus, who was a Cyren&aelig;an by birth, and a friend of
Callimachus, in his treatise on Extraordinary Rivers, says that in the
river Aroanius, which flows through Pheneum, there are fish which sing
like thrushes, and that they are called the poicili&aelig;. And Nymphodorus
the Syracusan, in his Voyages, says that there are pike in the river
Helorus, and large eels, so tame that they take bread out of the hands
of any who bring it to them. And I myself, and very likely many of you
too, have seen cestres tamed to the hand in the fountain of Arethusa,
near Chalcis; and eels, having silver and golden earrings, taking food
from any one who offered it to them, and entrails from the victims, and
fresh cheese. And Semus says, in the sixth book of his Delias&mdash;"They
say that a boy once dipped a ewer into the well, and brought water to
some Athenians who were sacrificing at Delos, to wash their hands with;
and he brought up, as it happened, some fish in the ewer along with the
water: and that on this the soothsayers of the Delians told them that
they should become the lords of the sea."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 525]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">AQUATIC ANIMALS.</div>

<p>4. And Polybius, in the thirty-fourth book of his Histories,
says that behind Pyrene, as far as the river Narbo, the whole country
is a plain, through which the rivers Illiberis and Rhoscynus proceed,
flowing through cities of the same name as themselves, which are
inhabited by some of the Celt&aelig;; and in this plain he says that the
above-mentioned fossil fish are also found. And he says that the soil
of that plain is light, and that a great quantity of the herb agrostis
grows in it; and that beneath it, as the soil is sandy for a depth of
two or three cubits, the water flows, which wanders away from these
rivers; and so the fish, too, leaving the rivers, and proceeding
underground, in the course of these erratic underflowings, in quest
of food (for they are exceedingly fond of the root of the agrostis),
have caused the whole plain to be full of subterranean fish, which
people catch when they dig up the plain. "And among the Indians," says
Theophrastus, "there are fish which go forth out of the rivers over
the land, and then, leaping back, return again to the water, just like
frogs; being in appearance very like the fish which are called maxini."</p>

<p>5. But I am not ignorant of what Clearchus, the Peripatetic
philosopher, has said about what he calls the exocoetus fish, or
fish which comes out of the water to sleep, which he mentions in his
work entitled A Treatise on Aquatic Animals. For he has said, (and I
think that I recollect his exact words, which are as follows,) "The
exocoetus fish, which some people call Adonis, has derived its name
from constantly taking his rest out of the water. He is rather of a red
colour, and from his gills down to his tail he has on each side of his
body one white stripe reaching the whole length of his body. And he
is round, but not being broad, he is equal in size to the cestrinisci
which are found near the shore; and they are as near as may be about
eight fingers in length. Altogether he is very like the fish called the
sea-goat, except that the latter has a black place under his stomach,
which they call the beard of the goat. And the exocoetus is one of
the fish which keeps near to the rocks, and spends his life in rocky
places. When it is calm weather he springs up with the waves and lies
on the rocks for a considerable time, sleeping on the dry land, and
turning himself so as to bask in the sun: and then, when he has had
sufficient rest, he rolls towards the water again, until the wave,
taking him again, bears him with the reflux back into the sea. And

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 526]</span>

when he is awake on the dry land then he is on his guard against those
birds which are called pareudist&aelig;, such as the halcyon, the sandpiper,
and the helorius, which is a bird like the rail. For these birds in
calm weather feed on the dry land, and often attack the exocoetus; but
when he sees them at a distance he flies, leaping and panting, until he
dives beneath the water."</p>

<p>6. Moreover, Clearchus says this also more plainly than Philostephanus
the Cyren&aelig;an, whom I have previously mentioned. "There are some fish
which, though they have no throats, can utter a sound. Such are those
which are found near Cleitor, in Arcadia, in the river called Ladon.
For they have a voice, and utter a very audible sound." And Nicolaus,
of Damascus, in the hundred and fourth book of his History, says&mdash;"In
the country around Apamea, in Phrygia, at the time of the Mithridatic
wars, there were some earthquakes, after which there appeared in that
district some lakes which previously had no existence, and rivers, and
other springs which had been opened by the earthquake. Many also which
had previously existed disappeared. And such a quantity of additional
water, which was brackish and of a sea-green colour, burst up in that
district, though it is at a very great distance from the sea, that
all the neighbouring country was filled with oysters and fish, and
all other productions of the sea." I know also that it has very often
rained fishes. At all events, Ph&aelig;nias, in the second book of his
Eresian Magistrates, says that in the Chersonesus it once rained fish
uninterruptedly for three days; and Phylarchus, in his fourth book,
says that people had often seen it raining fish, and often also raining
wheat, and that the same thing has happened with respect to frogs. At
all events, Heraclides Lembus, in the twenty-first book of his History,
says&mdash;"In P&aelig;onia and Dardania it has, they say, before now rained
frogs; and so great has been the number of these frogs that the houses
and the roads have been full of them; and at first, for some days, the
inhabitants, endeavouring to kill them, and shutting up their houses,
endured the pest; but when they did no good, but found that all their
vessels were filled with them, and the frogs were found to be boiled up
and roasted with everything they ate, and when besides all this, they
could not make use of any water, nor put their feet on the ground for
the heaps of frogs that were everywhere, and were annoyed also by the smell of
those that died, they fled the country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 527]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>7. I am aware, too, that Posidonius the Stoic makes this statement
about the abundance of the fish:&mdash;"When Tryphon of Apamea, who seized
upon the kingdom of Syria, was attacked by Sarpedon, the general
of Demetrius, near the city of Ptolemais, and when Sarpedon, being
defeated, retired into the inland parts of the country with his own
troops, but the army of Tryphon, having been victorious in the battle,
were marching along the shore, on a sudden, a wave of the sea, rising
to a great height, came over the land, and overwhelmed them all, and
destroyed them beneath the waters, and the retreating wave also left
an immense heap of fish with the corpses. And Sarpedon and his army
hearing of what had happened, came up, and were delighted at the sight
of the corpses of their enemies, and carried away an enormous quantity
of fish, and made a sacrifice to Neptune who puts armies to flight,
near the suburbs of the city."</p>

<p>8. Nor will I pass over in silence the men who prophesy from fish in
Lycia, concerning whom Polycharmus speaks, in the second book of his
Affairs of Lycia; writing in this manner:&mdash;"For when they have come
to the sea, at a place where there is on the shore a grove sacred to
Apollo, and where there is an eddy on the sand, the persons who are
consulting the oracle come, bringing with them two wooden spits, having
each of them ten pieces of roast meat on them. And the priest sits
down by the side of the grove in silence; but he who is consulting
the oracle throws the spits into the eddy, and looks on to see what
happens. And after he has put the spits in, then the eddy becomes full
of salt water, and there comes up such an enormous quantity of fish of
such a description that he is amazed at the sight, and is even, as it
were, alarmed at the magnitude of it. And when the prophet enumerates
the different species of fish, the person who is consulting the oracle
in this manner receives the prophecy from the priest respecting the
matters about which he has prayed for information. And there appear in
the eddy orphi, and sea-grayling, and sometimes some sorts of whales,
such as the phal&aelig;na, or pristis, and a great many other fish which are
rarely seen, and strange to the sight."</p>

<p>And Artemidorus, in the tenth book of his Geography, says that&mdash;"It is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 528]</span>

said by the natives that a fountain springs up in that place of sweet
water, to which it is owing that these eddies exist there; and that
very large fish are produced in that eddying place. And those who are
sacrificing throw to these fish the first-fruits of what they offer,
piercing them through with wooden spits, being pieces of meat, roasted
and boiled, and cakes of barley and loaves. And both the harbour and
the place is called Dinus."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>9. I know, too, that Phylarchus has spoken, somewhere or other, about
large fish, and about fresh figs which were sent with them; saying that
Patroclus, the general of Ptolemy, sent such a present to Antigonus
the king, by way of a riddle, as the Scythians sent an enigmatical
present to Darius, when he was invading their country. For they sent
(as Herodotus relates) a bird, and an arrow, and a frog. But Patroclus
(as Phylarchus tells us, in the third book of his Histories) sent
the before-mentioned fishes and figs; and the king, at the time that
they arrived, happened to be drinking with his friends, and when
all the party were perplexed at the meaning of the gifts, Antigonus
laughed, and said to his friends that he knew what was the meaning of
the present; "for," says he, "Patroclus means that we must either be
masters of the sea, or else be content to eat figs."</p>

<p>10. Nor am I unaware that all fishes are called by one generic name,
camasenes, by Empedocles the natural philosopher, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
How could the mighty trees and sea-born camasenes . . .
</div>

<p>And the poet, too, who wrote the Cyprian poems (whether he was a
Cyprian or a man of the name of Stasinus, or whatever else his name may
have been), represents Nemesis as pursued by Jupiter, and metamorphosed
into a fish, in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And after them she brought forth Helen third,<br />
A marvel to all mortal men to see;<br />
Her then the fair-hair'd Nemesis did bear,<br />
Compell'd by Jove, the sovereign of the gods.<br />
She indeed fled, nor sought to share the love<br />
Of that great father, son of Saturn, Jove;<br />
For too great awe did overpower her mind:<br />
So Nemesis did flee o'er distant lands,<br />
And o'er the black and barren waves o' the sea;
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 529]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
<div class="topspace-1">
But Jove pursued her (and with eagerness<br />
His soul desired her). In vain she took<br />
The form of some large fish who bounds along,<br />
Borne on the vast high-crested roaring wave;<br />
Sometimes she fled along the ocean, where<br />
The earth's most distant boundaries extend;<br />
Sometimes she fled along the fertile land;<br />
And took all shapes of every animal<br />
Which the land bears, to flee from amorous Jove.
</div>
</div>

<p>11. I know, also, what is related about the fish called apopyris,
which is found in the lake Bolbe; concerning which Hegesander, in his
Commentaries, speaks thus:&mdash;"Around Apollonia of Chalcis two rivers
flow, the Ammites and the Olynthiacus, and they both fall into the lake
Bolbe. And on the river Olynthiacus there is a monument of Olynthus,
the son of Hercules and Bolbe. And in the months Anthesterion and
Elaphebolion, the natives say that Bolbe sends Apopyris to Olynthus;
and that about this time a most enormous number of fish ascend out
of the lake into the river Olynthiacus: and this is a shallow river,
scarcely deep enough to wet a man's ankles; but for all that there does
not the less come a great number of fish, so that all the people of the
district get enough cured fish for their use for the year. And it is
a wonderful fact that they never pass above the monument of Olynthus.
They say, in explanation of this, that the people of Apollonia did
formerly, in the month Elaphebolion, celebrate sacrifices to the dead,
but that they do so now in the month Anthesterion; and that on this
account this ascent is made by the fish in those months alone in which
the natives are accustomed to pay honour to their national heroes."</p>

<p>12. And this is the state of the case, O men fish; for you, having
collected together every kind of thing, have thrown us out to be food
for fishes, instead of giving them as food for us,&mdash;making such long
speeches as not even Ichthys, the philosopher of Megara, nor Ichthyon
(and this also is a proper name), who is mentioned by Teleclides in his
Amphictyons, would make to us. And, on your account, I will give this
advice to the servant, as it is said in the Ant-Men of Pherecrates:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Mind that you never, O Deucalion,<br />
(Even if I bid you,) set a fish before me.
</div>

<p>For in Delos, as we are told by Semus the Delian, in the second book
of the Delias, when they sacrifice to Brizo,&mdash;and she is a deity who

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 530]</span>

prophesies to people asleep (for the ancients used <ins title="Greek: brizô">βριόζω</ins> as
synonymous with <ins title="Greek: katheudô">καθεύδω</ins>, to sleep, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then sleeping (<ins title="Greek: apobrixantes">ἀποβρίξαντες</ins>) there we waited for the dawn)&mdash;
</div>

<p>so, when the Delian women sacrifice to this deity, they bring her, as
their offering, boats full of all kinds of good things, except fish;
because they address prayers to her on every subject, and especially
for the safety of their vessels.</p>

<p>13. But, my friends, though I admire Chrysippus, the leader of the
sect of the Stoics, on many accounts, I also praise him especially for
having always classed Archestratus, that man who is so famous for his
treatise on Cookery, with Phil&aelig;nis, to whom that indelicate composition
about Amatory Pleasures is attributed; which, however, &AElig;schrion, the
iambic poet of Samos, says was written by Polycrates the sophist, and
attributed to Phil&aelig;nis for the sake of calumniating her, when she was a
most respectable woman. And the iambics, in which this is stated, run
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I am Phil&aelig;nis, famous among men;<br />
And here I lie, o'erwhelm'd by long old age.<br />
Do not, O foolish sailor, pass this cape<br />
Laughing and scorning and reproaching me.<br />
For now I swear by Jove, and by the gods<br />
Who reign below, I never lustful was,<br />
I never made myself a sport to man.<br />
But one Polycrates, of Attic race,<br />
A trashy chatterer, and a false accuser,<br />
Wrote what he wrote; I know not what it was.
</div>

<p>Therefore that admirable Chrysippus, in the fifth book of his treatise
on Honour and Pleasure, says&mdash;"The books, too, of Phil&aelig;nis, and the
Gastronomy of Archestratus, and all the drugs calculated to provoke
appetite or sensual desires, and also all the servants who are skilled
in such motions and such figures, and whose occupation it is to attend
to these things." And again he says&mdash;"That they learn such things,
and get hold of the books written on such subjects by Phil&aelig;nis and
Archestratus, and by those who have written similar works." And in his
seventh book he says&mdash;"Just as it would not be advisable to study the
writings of Phil&aelig;nis or the Gastronomy of Archestratus, as tending to
make a person live better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 531]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRESENT ENJOYMENT.</div>

<p>14. But you, who are constantly making mention of this Archestratus,
have made this entertainment full of intemperance; for what of all
the things which could unduly excite men has this fine epic poet
omitted?&mdash;he, the only imitator of the life of Sardanapalus the
son of Anacyndaraxes, who, Aristotle says, is made more obscure still
by adding the name of his father; on whose tomb, Chrysippus says, the
following inscription was engraved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Knowing that you are mortal, feed your soul<br />
On banquets and delights; for in the grave<br />
There's no enjoyment left. I now am dust<br />
Who once was king of mighty Nineveh;<br />
The things which I did eat, the joys of love,<br />
The insolent thoughts with which my wealth did fill me,<br />
Are all I now have left; for all my power<br />
And all my happiness is gone for ever.<br />
This is the only prudent rule of life,<br />
I never shall forget it, let who will<br />
Hoard boundless treasures of uncounted gold.
</div>

<p>And the great poet has said of the Ph&aelig;acians&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To dress, to dance, to sing, our sole delight,<br />
The feast or bath by day, and love by night.
</div>

<p>And another person, not unlike Sardanapalus in disposition, gives this
advice and these rules to those who are deficient in wisdom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I to all mortals now give this advice:<br />
Live for the day with pleasure; he who dies<br />
Is nought; an empty shade beneath the earth:<br />
Man lives but a short space, and therefore should,<br />
While life remains, enjoy himself.
</div>

<p>And Amphis the comic poet, in his Ialemus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The man who knows that he is but a mortal,<br />
And yet seeks not enjoyment while alive,<br />
Leaving all other cares, is but a fool<br />
In mine and all wise men's opinion,<br />
And most unhappy in his destiny.
</div>

<p>And, in his play entitled the Gyn&aelig;cocracy, he says nearly the same&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Drink and play, our mortal life<br />
<span class="linespace1">On earth can but a brief space last;</span><br />
Death alone will last for ever.<br />
<span class="linespace1">When once our too brief term is past.</span>
</div>

<p>And a man of the name of Bacchides, who lived on the same principles as
Sardanapalus, after he was dead had the following inscription placed on
his tomb:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Eat, drink, indulge thy soul with all delights,<br />
This stone is all that now remains for Bacchides.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 532]</span></p>

<p>15. Alexis, in his Tutor of Intemperate Men&mdash;(as Sotion the Alexandrian
says, in his Commentary on the Silli of Timon; for I myself have never
met with the play, though I have read more than eight hundred plays of
what is called the Middle Comedy, and have made extracts from them, but
still I have never fallen in with the Tutor of Intemperate Men, nor do
I recollect having seen any mention of it in any regular list of such
plays; for Callimachus has not inserted it in his catalogue nor has
Aristophanes, nor even those scholars at Pergamus, who have handed down
to us lists of plays,)&mdash;however, Sotion says that in that play a slave,
named Xanthias, was represented as exhorting all his fellow-slaves to a
life of luxury, and saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Why do you talk such stuff, why run about<br />
To the Lyceum and the Academy,<br />
To the Odeum's gates, hunting in vain<br />
For all the sophists' nonsense? there's no good in it;<br />
Let us drink, drink, I say. O Sicon, Sicon!<br />
Let us amuse ourselves; while time allows us<br />
To gratify our souls.&mdash;Enjoy yourself,<br />
My good friend Manes! nothing is worth more<br />
To you than your own stomach. That's your father;<br />
That only is your mother;&mdash;as for virtues,<br />
And embassies, and military commands,<br />
They are but noisy boasts, vain empty dreams.<br />
Fate at its destined hour will come to chill you;<br />
Take all that you can get to eat and drink;<br />
Pericles, Codrus, Cimon, are but dust.
</div>

<p>16. But it would be better, says Chrysippus, if the lines inscribed on
the tomb of Sardanapalus were altered thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Knowing that thou art mortal, feed thy soul<br />
On wise discourse. There is no good in eating.<br />
For I am now no good, who once did eat<br />
All that I could, and sought all kinds of pleasure.<br />
Now what I thought and learnt and heard of wisdom<br />
Is all I now have left; my luxuries<br />
And all my joys have long deserted me.
</div>

<p>And Timon says, very beautifully,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Of all bad things the chief is appetite.
</div>

<p>17. But Clearchus, in his essay on Proverbs, says that Terpsion
was the tutor of Archestratus, who was also the first person who
wrote a book on Gastronomy; and he says that he gave precepts to his
pupils as to what they ought to abstain from; and that Terpsion once
extemporised the following line about a turtle:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 533]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Eat now a turtle, or else leave it alone;
</div>

<p>which, however, others read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Eat now a turtle's flesh, or leave it alone.
</div>

<p>18. But whence is it, O you wisest of men, that Dorion, who wrote a
list of fish, has been mentioned as if he were the writer of some
valuable history?&mdash;a fellow who, I know, has been named a musician and
a fish-devourer, but certainly not a historian. Accordingly Machon, the
comic poet, speaks of him as a musician, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Dorion the musician once did come<br />
To Mylon, all in vain; for he could find<br />
No resting-place which he could hire at all;<br />
So on some sacred ground he sat him down,<br />
Which was by chance before the city gates,<br />
And there he saw the keeper of the temple<br />
Prepare a sacrifice.&mdash;"I pray thee, tell me,<br />
In chaste Minerva's name, and all the gods',<br />
What deity is it that owns this temple?"<br />
The keeper thus replied: "This is, O stranger,<br />
Of Jupiter-Neptune the sacred shrine."<br />
"How then," said Dorion, "could any man<br />
Expect to find a lodging in a place<br />
Which in one temple crowds a pair of gods?"
</div>

<p>And Lynceus the Samian, the pupil of Theophrastus, and the brother of
Duris, who wrote the Histories, and made himself tyrant of his country,
writes thus in his Apophthegms&mdash; "When a man once said to Dorion the
flute-player, that the ray was a good fish, he said&mdash;'Yes, about as
good as if a man were to eat a boiled cloak.' And once, when some one
else praised the entrails of tunny-fish, he said&mdash;'You are quite right,
but then a man must eat them as I eat them;' and when the man asked him
how that was, he said&mdash;'How? why willingly.' And he said that crawfish
had three good qualities,&mdash;exercise, good food, and contemplation.
And once, at Cyprus, when he was supping with Nicocreon, he praised a
goblet that there was there; and Nicocreon said&mdash;'Whatever there is
here that you fancy, the artist will make you another like it.' 'Let
him make that,' he replied, 'for you; but do you give me this one.'"
And this was a clever speech of the flute-player; for there is an old
saying that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
'Tis not that God denies a flutist sense,<br />
But when he comes to blow it flies away.

<p>19. And Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says this of him&mdash;"Dorion,
the great fish-eater, once, when his slave had neglected to buy fish,
scourged him, and ordered him to tell him the names of the best fish;
and when the boy had counted up the orphus, and the sea-grayling, and
the conger, and others of this sort, he said&mdash;'I desired you to tell me
the names of fishes, and not of gods.'" The same Dorion, ridiculing the
description of a tempest in the Nautilus of Timotheus, said that he had
seen a more formidable storm in a boiling saucepan. And Aristodemus,
in the second book of his Memorials of Laughable Circumstances and
Sayings, says&mdash;"Dorion the musician was club-footed; and once, in some
entertainment, he lost the slipper of his lame foot; on which he said,
'I will not wish anything more to the thief than that the slipper may
fit him.'" But that this Dorion was notorious for his epicurism in
fish, is plain from what Mnesimachus the comic poet says in his drama
called Philip&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No, but all night Dorion the dish-piper<br />

<p>20. I know, too, the sportive sayings which Lasus of Hermione has
uttered about fishes; which Cham&aelig;leon of Heraclea has recorded in
writing, in his book on this very Lasus, where he says&mdash;"They say
that Lasus called raw fish <ins title="Greek: optos">ὀπτὸς</ins> (which means roasted or
visible); and when many people wondered why he did so, he thus began
to prove what he had said; arguing thus: 'As whatever a person can
hear (<ins title="Greek: akousai">ἀκοῦσαι</ins>) is properly called <ins title="Greek: akouston">ἀκουστὸν</ins>,
and as whatever a person can understand by his intellect (<ins title="Greek: noêsai">νοῆσαι</ins>) is
properly called <ins title="Greek: noêton">νοητὸν</ins>, so whatever any one can see (<ins title="Greek: optesthai">ὄπτεσθαι</ins>)
is clearly <ins title="Greek: opton">ὀπτόν</ins>; as therefore it was possible to
see the fish, he evidently was <ins title="Greek: optos">ὀπτός</ins>.' And once, in a joke, he
stole a fish from a fisherman, and having taken it, he gave it to one
of the bystanders; and when the fisherman put him to his oath, he swore
that he had not got it himself, and that he had not seen any one else
take it; because, in fact, he himself had taken it, but some one else
had got it. And then he prompted the other man, on the other hand, to
swear that he had not taken it himself, and that he was not acquainted
with any one else who had it; for, in fact, Lasus had taken it, and he
himself had it." And Epicharmus jests in the same way; as, in his Logus
and Logina,&mdash;</p>

<p>21. And Alexis, in his Demetrius, ridicules, in his comic manner, a man
of the name of Phayllus, as very fond of fish, in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
First of all, whether the wind blew north or south,<br />
As long as it blew hard, it was not possible<br />
For anybody to get fish to eat.<br />
But now, besides that pair of stormy winds,<br />
We've a third tempest risen in Phayllus;<br />
For when this last storm bursts upon the market,<br />
He buys up all the fish at all the stalls,<br />
And bears it off; so that we are reduced<br />
To squabble for the vegetables remaining.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Female Fisher, enumerating some people as
exceedingly fond of fish, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Give me some cuttle-fish first. O Hercules!<br />
They've dirtied every place with ink; here, take them<br />
And throw them back again into the sea,<br />
To wash them clean: or else they'll say, O Dorion,<br />
That you have caught some rotten cuttle-fish:<br />
And put this crawfish back beside the sprats.<br />
He's a fine fish, by Jove. O mighty Jove,<br />
O you Callimedon, who now will eat you?<br />
No one who's not prepared to pay his share.<br />
I've giv'n you your place here on the right,<br />
You mullets, food of great Callisthenes;<br />
Who eats his patrimony in one dish;<br />
Next comes the mighty conger from Sinope,<br />
With his stout spines; the first who comes shall have him;<br />
For Misgolas has no great love for such.<br />
But here's a citharus, and if he sees him<br />
He never will keep off his hands from him;<br />
For he, indeed, does secretly adhere<br />
As close as wax to all the harp-players (<ins title="Greek: kitharôdois">κιθαρῳδοῖς</ins>).<br />
I ought to send this best of fish, this tench,<br />
Still all alive, and leaping in his dish,<br />
To the fair Pythionica, he's so fine:<br />
But still she will not taste him, as her heart<br />
Is wholly set on cured fish.&mdash;Here I place<br />
These thin anchovies and this dainty turtle<br />
Apart for Theano, to counterbalance her.
</div>

<p>22. And it is a very clever way in which Antiphanes thus jested upon
Misgolas, as devoting all his attention to beautiful harp-players and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 536]</span>

lyre-players; for &AElig;schines the orator, in his speech against Timarchus,
says this of him&mdash;"Misgolas, the son of Naucrates, of Colyttus, O men
of Athens, is a man in other respects brave and virtuous, and no one
can find any fault with him in any particular; but he is known to be
exceedingly devoted to this kind of business, and always to have about
him some harp-players, and people who sing to the music of the harp.
And I say this, not by way of disparaging him, but in order that you
may be aware what sort of person he is." And Timocles, in his Sappho,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Misgolas is not seen to enter in,<br />
Excited as he is by blooming youth.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Agonis, or the Little Horse, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O mother, do not threaten me, I pray,<br />
With Misgolas, for I am not a harp-player.
</div>

<p>23. But Antiphanes says that Pythionica is fond of cured fish, since
she had for lovers the sons of Ch&aelig;rephilus, the seller of salt-fish; as
Timocles says, in his Icarians,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When that stout Anytus to Pythionica<br />
Does come, to eat with her; for she invites him,<br />
As people say, whenever she does get<br />
Two noble tunnies from Ch&aelig;rephilus;<br />
So fond is she of all things that are large.
</div>

<p>And again he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And Pythionica will receive you gladly,<br />
And very likely will devour the gifts<br />
Which you have lately here received from us,<br />
For she's insatiable. Still do you<br />
Bid her give you a basket of cured fish;<br />
For she has plenty; and she has indeed<br />
A couple of saperd&aelig;; ugly fish,<br />
Ill salted, and broad nosed.
</div>

<p>And before this she had a lover whose name was Cobius.</p>

<p>24. But with respect to Callimedon, the son of Carabus, Timocles, in
his Busybody, tells us that he was fond of fish, and also that he
squinted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then up came Carabus Callimedon,<br />
And looking on me, as it seem'd to me,<br />
He kept on speaking to some other man.<br />
And I, as it was likely, understanding<br />
No word of what they said, did only nod.<br />
But all the girls do keep on looking at him,<br />
While they pretend to turn their eyes away.

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 537]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>And he ridicules him in a similar manner in the play entitled The Men
running together. But he also jests on him for his epicurism as to
fish, in the Ph&aelig;do, or Ph&aelig;dria, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> You shall be &aelig;dile if the gods approve,</span><br />

I'll willingly be turn'd into an eel,<br />

expression, says&mdash;"And the slave put before the young man himself with
great eagerness a little eel: his father had a fine cuttle-fish before
him. 'Father,' says he, 'what do you think of your crawfish?' 'It is
cold,' says he; 'take it away,&mdash;I don't want to eat any orators.'"<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>And when Philemon says, in his Canvasser,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 538]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
Agyrrius, when a crawfish was before him,<br />
On seeing him exclaim'd, Hail, dear papa!<br />

<p>And Herodicus the Cratetian, commenting on this in his Miscellaneous
Commentaries, says that Agyrrius was the name of the son of Callimedon.</p>

<p>25. The following people, too, have all been great epicures about
fish. Antagoras the poet would not allow his slave to touch his fish
with oil, but made him wash it; as Hegesander tells us. And when in
the army, he was once boiling a dish of congers, and had his clothes
girt round him, Antigonus the king, who was standing by, said, "Tell
me, Antagoras, do you think that Homer, who celebrated the exploits
of Agamemnon, ever boiled congers?" And it is said that he answered,
not without wit, "And do you think that Agamemnon, who performed those
exploits, ever busied himself about inquiring who was cooking congers
in his army?" And once, when Antagoras was cooking a bird of some kind,
he said that he would not go to the bath, because he was afraid that
the slaves might come and suck up the gravy. And when Philocydes said
that his mother would take care of that, "Shall I," said he, "entrust
the gravy of game to my mother?" And Androcydes of Cyzicus, the
painter, being very fond of fish, as Polemo relates, carried his luxury
to such a pitch that he even painted with great care the fish which are
around Scylla.</p>

<p>26. But concerning Philoxenus of Cythera, the dithyrambic poet, Machon
the comic poet writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They say Philoxenus, the ancient poet<br />
Of dithyrambics, was so wonderfully<br />
Attach'd to fish, that once at Syracuse<br />
He bought a polypus two cubits long,<br />
Then dress'd it, and then ate it up himself,<br />
All but the head&mdash;and afterwards fell sick,<br />
Seized with a sharp attack of indigestion.<br />
Then when some doctor came to him to see him,<br />
Who saw that he was greatly out of order;<br />
"If," said the doctor, "you have any business<br />
Not well arranged, do not delay to settle it,<br />
For you will die before six hours are over."<br />
Philoxenus replied, "All my affairs,<br />
O doctor, are well ended and arranged,<br />
Long, long ago. By favour of the gods,<br />
I leave my dithyrambics all full-grown,<br />
And crown'd with many a prize of victory;

<div class="topspace-1">
<div class="blockindent">
And I commit them to the guardianship<br />

This is my will. But now, since Charon gives<br />

Keeps crying out, 'Now cross;' and deadly fate<br />
Calls me away, who can't be disobey'd,<br />

</div>
</div>

<p>And in another part he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Philoxenus of Cythera, as men say,<br />
Wished that he had a throat three cubits long;<br />
"That I might drink," said he, "as long as possible,<br />
And that my food may all at once delight me."
</div>

<p>And Diogenes the Cynic, having eaten a polypus raw, died of a swelling
in the belly. But concerning Philoxenus, Sopater the parodist also
speaks, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For, between two rich courses of fine fish,<br />
He pleased himself by looking down the centre<br />
Of &AElig;tna's crater.
</div>

<p>27. And Hyperides the orator was an epicure in fish; as Timocles the
comic writer tells us, in his Delos, where he enumerates all the people
who had taken bribes from Harpalus: and he writes thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Demosthenes has half-a-hundred talents.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> A lucky man, if no one shares with him.</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Why, he will all our fishmongers enrich;</span><br />

<p>And in the Icarians, the same poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And Philet&aelig;rus, in his &AElig;sculapius, says that Hyperides, besides being
a glutton, was also a gambler. As also Axionicus, in his Lover of
Euripides, says that Callias the orator was; and his words are&mdash;"A

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 540]</span>

man of the name of Glaucus came to this place, bringing from Pontus a
kind of shark, a fish of extraordinary magnitude,&mdash;a great dainty for
epicures in fish, and, in fact, for all men who are devoted to the
pleasures of the table. And he brought it on his shoulders, and said,
'Whom shall I instruct how to dress it, and how shall it be dressed?
Will you have it soaked in a sauce of green herbs, or shall I baste its
body with basting of warm brine, and then dress it on a fierce fire?
And a man named Moschio, a great flute-player, cried out that he should
like to eat it boiled in warm pickle-juice. And this was meant as a
reproof for you, O Calaides! for you are very fond of figs and cured
fish; and yet you will not taste a most exquisite fish which you have
served up to you in pickle." Reproaching him with the figs as if he
were a sycophant; and perhaps concealing under the mention of the cured
fish, some intimation of his having been implicated in discreditable
conduct. And Hermippus says, in the third book of his treatise on the
Pupils of Isocrates, that Hyperides was in the habit of taking a walk,
the first thing in the morning, in the fish-market.</p>

<p>28. And Tim&aelig;us of Tauromenium says that Aristotle the philosopher was a
great epicure in respect of fish. Matron the sophist, also, was a great
fish-eater: and Antiphanes, in his Harp-player, intimates this; for
that play begins thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He tells no lie . . . .<br />
A man dug out his eye, as Matron does<br />
The eyes of fish when he comes near to them.
</div>

<p>And Anaxilas says, in his Morose Man,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Matron has carried off and eaten up<br />
A cestris' head; and I am quite undone.
</div>

<p>It being the very extravagance of gluttony to carry a thing off while
eating it, and such a thing too as the head of a cestris; unless,
perhaps, you may suppose, that those who are skilful in such things are
aware of there being some particular good qualities in the head of a
cestris; and if so, it belonged to Archestratus's gluttony to explain
that to us.</p>

<p>29. But Antiphanes, in his Rich Man, gives us a catalogue of epicures,
in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Euthymus too was there, with sandals on,<br />
A ring upon his finger, well perfumed,<br />
Silently pondering on I know not what.

<div class="sidenote-left">EPICURES.</div>

<div class="topspace-1">
<div class="blockindent">
Ph&oelig;nicides too, and my friend Taureas,<br />
Such great inveterate epicures that they<br />
Would swallow all the remnants in the market;<br />
They at this sight seem'd almost like to die.<br />
And bore the scarcity with small good-humour;<br />
But gather'd crowds and made this speech to them:&mdash;<br />
"What an intolerable thing it is<br />
That any of you men should claim the sea,<br />
And spend much money in marine pursuits,<br />
While not one fin of fish comes to this market!<br />
What is the use of all our governors<br />
Who sway the islands? We must make a law<br />
That there should be copious importation<br />
Of every kind of fish. But Matron now<br />
Has carried off the fishermen; and then<br />
There's Diogeiton, who, by Jove, has brought<br />
The hucksters over to keep back for him<br />
All the best fish; and he's not popular<br />
For doing this, for there is mighty waste<br />
In marriage-feasts and youthful luxury."
</div>
</div>

<p>But Euphron, in his Muses, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when at some fine banquet of young men<br />
Ph&oelig;nicides perceived a smoking dish<br />
Full of the sons of Nereus, he held back<br />
His hands, with rage excited. Thus he spoke:&mdash;<br />
"Who boasts himself a clever parasite<br />
At eating at the public cost? who thinks<br />
To filch the dainty dishes from the middle?<br />
Where's Corydus, or Phyromachus, or Nillus?<br />
Let them come here, they shall get nought of this."
</div>

<p>30. But Melanthus the tragic poet was a person of the same sort; and
he also wrote elegies. But Leucon, in his Men of the same Tribe, cuts
his jokes upon him in the fashion of the comic writers, on account of
his gluttony; and so does Aristophanes in the Peace, and Pherecrates in
his Petale. But Archippus, in his play called The Fishes, having put
him in chains as an epicure, gives him up to the fishes, to be eaten
by them in retaliation. And, indeed, even Aristippus, the pupil of
Socrates, was a great epicure,&mdash;a man who was once reproached by Plato
for his gluttony, as Sotion and Hegesander relate. And the Delphian
writes thus:&mdash;"Aristippus, when Plato reproached him for having bought
a number of fish, said that he had bought them for two obols; and when
Plato said, 'I myself would have bought them at that price,' 'You see,
then,' said he, 'O Plato! that it is not I who am an epicure, but you
who are a miser.'" And Antiphanes, in his Female Flute-player, or the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 542]</span>

Female Twins, laughing at a man named Ph&oelig;nicides for his gluttony,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

Ph&oelig;nicides, too, attacks Taureas<br />

<p>31. But Demosthenes the orator reproaches Pherecrates, because,
with the gold which he received for his treason, he bought himself
courtesans and fish, and charges him with debauchery and gluttony. But
Diocles the epicure, as Hegesander says, when a man once asked him
which of the two fish was the best, the conger or the pike, said&mdash;"The
one when it is boiled, and the other when it is roasted." And Leonteus
the Argive also was an epicure: he was a tragedian, and a pupil of
Athenion, and a slave of Juba, king of Mauritania; as Amarantus
relates, in his treatise on the Stage, saying that Juba wrote this
epigram on him, because he had acted the character of Hypsipyle very
badly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If you should wish to see the genius<br />
Of that devoted artichoke-devourer<br />
Leonteus the tragedian, don't regard<br />
The sorrow-stricken heart of Hypsipyle.<br />
I once was dear to Bacchus, and his taste<br />
Is ne'er perverted by base bribes t'approve<br />
Untuneful sounds. But now the pots and pans,<br />
And well-fill'd dishes have destroyed my voice,<br />
While I've been anxious to indulge my stomach.
</div>

<p>32. And Hegesander tells us that Phoryscus, the fish-eater, once, when
he was not able to take exactly as much fish as he wished, but when a
greater part of it was following his hand, as he was helping himself,
said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But what resists is utterly destroy'd,
</div>

<p>and so ate up the whole fish. And Bion, when some one had been
beforehand with him, and had already taken the upper part of the fish,
having turned it round himself, and eating abundantly of it, said,
after he had done,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But Ino finish'd all the rest o' the business.

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 543]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EPICURES.</div>

<p>And Theocritus the Chian, when the wife of Diocles the epicure died,
and when the widowed husband, while making a funeral feast for her,
kept on eating delicacies and crying all the time, said&mdash;"Stop crying,
you wretched man; for you will not remedy your grief by eating all that
fish." And when the same Diocles had also eaten up his land through gluttony, and was
one day, while bolting down some hot fish, complaining that his palate
(<ins title="Greek: ouranos">οὐρανὸς</ins>) was burnt, Theocritus, who was present, said to
him&mdash;"Then it only remains for you to drink up the sea, and then you
will have got rid of the three greatest things in the world,&mdash;earth,
and sea, and heaven (<ins title="Greek: ouranos">οὐρανός</ins>)." And Clearchus, in his Lives,
describing some person who was fond of fish, says&mdash;"Technon, one of
the old flute-players, when Charmus the flute-player died, (and he,
too, was very fond of fish,) sacrificed to the dead man a large dish
of every sort of fish on his tomb." Alexis the poet, also, was a
great epicure in fish, as Lynceus the Samian tells us; and being once
ridiculed by some chattering fellows on account of his epicurism,
when they asked him what he liked most to eat, Alexis said, "Roasted
chatterers."</p>

<p>33. Hermippus mentions also Nothippus the tragic poet, in his Tales,
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But if such a race of men<br />
<span class="linespace1">Were to wage a present war</span><br />
With those who now exist on earth,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And if a roast ray led them on,</span><br />
Or a fine side of well-fed pork,<br />
<span class="linespace1">The rest might safely stay at home,</span><br />
And trust Nothippus by himself,<br />
<span class="linespace1">For he alone would swallow up</span><br />
The whole Peloponnesus:&mdash;
</div>

<p>and that the man meant here was the poet, Teleclides shows plainly, in
his Hesiods.</p>

<p>Myniscus, the tragic actor, is ridiculed by Plato, the comic writer, in
his Syrphax, as an epicure in respect of fish; where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Here is an Anagyrasian orphus for you,</span><br />
Which e'en my friend Myniscus the Chalcidean<br />

<span class="linespace7_5"><i>B.</i> Much obliged to you.</span>
</div>

<p>And for a similar reason, Callias, in his Pedet&aelig;, and Lysippus, in his
Bacch&aelig;, ridicule Lampon the soothsayer. But Cratinus, in his Female
Runaways, speaking of him, says&mdash;"Lampon, whom nothing which men said
of him could keep away from any banquet of his friends;" and adds, "But
now again he is belching away; for he devours everything which he can
see, and he would fight even for a mullet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 544]</span></p>

<p>34. And Hedylus, in his Epigrams, giving a list of epicures in fish,
mentions a man named Ph&aelig;do, in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But Ph&aelig;do, that great harpist, praises phyces,<br />
And sausages, he's such an epicure.
</div>

<p>And he mentions Agisoto, in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The fish is boil'd, now firmly bar the doors,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Lest Agis, Proteus of the dishes, enter;</span><br />
For he'll be fire, water,&mdash;what he likes;<br />
<span class="linespace1">But bar the door . . . . . .</span><br />
For he, transform'd, like Jupiter, to gold<br />
<span class="linespace1">Will hasten to this rich Acrisian dish.</span>
</div>

<p>He also speaks of a woman named Clio, on a similar account, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Clio's an epicure. Let's shut our eyes.<br />
<span class="linespace1">I beg you, Clio, by yourself to feed.</span><br />

<p>35. And Aristodemus, in his Catalogue of Laughable Sayings, says that
Euphranor the epicure, having heard that another epicure in fish
was dead from having eaten a hot slice of fish, cried out, "What a
sacrilegious death!" And Cindon the fish-eater, and Demylus (and he
also was an epicure in fish), when a sea-grayling was set before them,
and nothing else, the former took one eye of the fish, and then Demylus
seized hold of Cindon's eye, crying, "Let his eye go, and I will let
your's go." And once at a feast, when a fine dish of fish was served
up, Demylus, not being able to contrive any way by which he might get
the whole of it to himself, spat upon it. And Zeno the Citti&aelig;an, the
founder of the Stoic school, when he had lived a long time with a great
epicure in fish, (as Antigonus the Carystian tells us, in his life of
Zeno,) once, when a very large fish was by chance served up to them,
and when no other food was provided, took the whole fish from the
platter, pretending to be about to eat it all himself; and, when the
other looked at him, said&mdash;"What do you think, then, that those who
live with you must suffer every day, if you cannot endure my being a
glutton for a single day?" And Ister says that Choerilus the poet used
to receive four min&aelig; every day from Archelaus, and that he spent them
all on fish, of which he was so exceedingly fond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 545]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EPICURES.</div>

<p>I am aware, also, that there have been boys who were great fish-eaters,
who are mentioned by Clearchus, in his book on Sands; which says
that Psammitichus, king of Egypt, bred up some boys to eat nothing
but fish, when he was anxious to discover the source of the Nile;
and that he accustomed others to endure a great degree of thirst,
who were to be employed in exploring the sands in Libya; of whom,
however, very few escaped in safety. I know, too, that the oxen around
Mosynus, in Thrace, eat fish, which are given to them in their cribs.
And Ph&oelig;nicides, having set fish before men who had brought their
contribution for a banquet, said that the sea was common, but that the
fish in it belonged to those who bought them.</p>

<p>36. And, my friends, the noun <ins title="Greek: opsophagos">ὀψοφάγος</ins> (an eater of
fish), and the verb <ins title="Greek: opsophagô">ὀψοφάγω</ins> (to eat fish), are both used.
Aristophanes, in his second edition of the Clouds, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Not to eat fish (<ins title="Greek: opsophagein">ὀψοφάγειν</ins>) nor to giggle.
</div>

<p>And Cephisodorus, in his Pig, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Not a fish-eater (<ins title="Greek: opsophagos">οψοφαγος</ins>) nor a chatterer.
</div>

<p>Machon, in his Letter, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I am a fish-eater (<ins title="Greek: opsophagos">ὀψοφάγος</ins>), and this is now<br />
The whole foundation of the art we practise.<br />
And he who wishes not to spoil the dishes<br />
Served up to others, should be pleased himself.<br />
For he who rightly cares for his own eating<br />
Will not be a bad cook. And if you keep<br />
Your organs, sense and taste, in proper order,<br />
You will not err. But often taste your dishes<br />
While you are boiling them. Do they want salt?<br />
Add some;&mdash;is any other seasoning needed?<br />
Add it, and taste again&mdash;till you've arrived<br />
At harmony of flavour; like a man<br />
Who tunes a lyre till it rightly sounds.<br />
And then, when everything is well in tune,<br />
Bring in a troop of willing damsels fair,<br />
Equal in number to the banqueters.
</div>

<p>In addition to these epicures in fish, my friends, I am aware also that
Apollo is honoured among the Eleans, under the title of Fish-eater:
and Polemo mentions this name of his in his letter to Attalus. I am
aware, also, that in Pisa there is a picture consecrated in the temple
of Diana Alpheosa (and it is the work of Cleanthes the Corinthian), in
which Neptune is represented as bringing a tunny to Jupiter in labour;
as Demetrius tells us, in the eighth book of his Trojan Array.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 546]</span></p>

<p>37. These, then, are the things, said Democritus, which I myself
have brought in the way of my contribution, not going to eat fish
myself, for the sake of my excellent friend Ulpian; who, on account
of the national customs of the Syrians, has deprived us of our fish,
continually bringing forward one thing after another. And Antipater of
Tarsus, the Stoic philosopher, in the fourth book of his treatise on
Superstition, tells us that it is said by some people that Gatis, the
queen of the Syrians, was so exceedingly fond of fish, that she issued
a proclamation that no one should eat fish without Gatis being invited
(<ins title="Greek: ater Gatidos">ἄτερ γάτιδος</ins>); and that the common people, out of ignorance,
thought her name was Atergatis, and abstained wholly from fish. And
Mnaseus, in the second book of his History of Asia, speaks thus&mdash;"But
I think that Atergatis was a very bad queen, and that she ruled the
people with great harshness, so that she even forbad them by law to eat
fish, and ordered them to bring all the fish to her, because she was
so fond of that food; and, on account of this order of hers, a custom
still prevails, when the Syrians pray to the goddess, to offer her
golden or silver fish; and for the priests every day to place on the
table before the god real fish also, carefully dressed, both boiled and
roasted, which the priests of the goddess eat themselves." And a little
further on, he says again&mdash;"But Atergatis (as Xanthus the Lydian says),
being taken prisoner by Mopsus, king of Lydia, was drowned with her son
in the lake near Ascalon, because of her insolence, and was eaten up by
fishes."</p>

<p>38. And you, perhaps, my friends, have willingly passed by (as if it
were some sacred fish) the fish mentioned by Ephippus the comic poet,
which he says was dressed for Geryon, in his play called Geryon. The
lines are these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> When the natives of the land</span><br />

But fine, as large as the whole isle<br />

And orders all who live around,<br />
Sindi, and Lycians, and Paphians,<br />
Cranai, and Mygdoniot&aelig;,<br />
To cut down wood, because the king<br />
Is boiling this enormous fish.<br />
So then they bring a load of wood,<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">EPICURES.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
<div class="topspace-1">
And light the fire. Then they bring<br />
A lake of water to make brine,<br />
And for eight months a hundred carts<br />
Are hard at work to carry salt.<br />
And around the dish's edge<br />
Five five-oar'd boats keep always rowing;<br />
And bid the slaves take care the fire<br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Cease to blow this cold air on us,</span><br />

The Celts, and do not burn them more.
</div>
</div>

<p>But I am not ignorant that Ephippus has said the very same thing in
his play called the Peltast; in which the following lines also are
subjoined to those which I have just quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Talking all this nonsense, he<br />
Raises the wonder of the youths<br />
With whom he feasts, though knowing not<br />
The simplest sums and plainest figures;<br />
But drags his cloak along the ground<br />
With a most lordly, pompous air.
</div>

<p>But, with reference to whom it is that Ephippus said this, it is now
proper for you to inquire, my good friend Ulpian, and then to tell us;
and in this inquiry&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If you find aught hard and inexplicable,<br />
Repeat it over, understand it clearly,&mdash;<br />
For I have much more leisure than I like;
</div>

<p>as Prometheus says in &AElig;schylus.</p>

<p>39. And on this Cynulcus exclaimed:&mdash;And what great subject of
inquiry,&mdash;I do not say great fish,&mdash;can this fellow admit into his
mind?&mdash;a man who is always picking out the spines of hepseti and
atherin&aelig;, and even of worse fish than these, if there be any such,
passing over all finer fish.</p>

<p>For, as Eubulus says, in the Ixion,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
As if a man at a luxurious feast,<br />
When cheese cakes are before him, chooses nought<br />
But anise, parsley, and such silly fare,<br />
And ill-dress'd cardamums . . . .
</div>

<p>so, too, this Pot-friend, Ulpian,&mdash;to use a word of my
fellow-Megalopolitan, Cercidas,&mdash;appears to me to eat nothing that a
man ought to eat, but to watch those who are eating, to see if they
have passed over any spine or any callous or gristly morsel of the
meat set before them; never once considering what the admirable and
brilliant &AElig;schylus has said, who called his tragedies, "Relics of
the noble banquets of Homer." But &AElig;schylus was one of the greatest
of philosophers,&mdash;a man who, being once defeated undeservedly, as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 548]</span>

Theophrastus or Cham&aelig;leon (whichever was really the author of the
book), in his treatise on Pleasure, has related, said that he committed
his tragedies to time, well knowing that, he should hereafter receive
the honour due to him.</p>

<p>40. But whence could Ulpian know what Stratonicus the harp-player said
about Propis the Rhodian harp-player? For Clearchus, in his book on
Proverbs, says that Stratonicus, when he had seen Propis, who was a man
of great size, but a very inferior artist, with a mind much less than
his body, said to some one who asked him what sort of player he was,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: Oudeis kakos megas ichthys">οὐδεὶς κακὸς μέγας ἰχθῖς</ins>;
</div>

<p>speaking enigmatically, and saying, first of all, that he is <ins title="Greek: oudeis">οὐδεὶς</ins>,
no one, or good-for-nothing; secondly, that he is
<ins title="Greek: kakos">κακὸς</ins>, bad; and, in addition to this, that he is <ins title="Greek: megas">μέγας</ins>,
great; and, lastly,<ins title="Greek: ichthys"> ἰχθὺς</ins>, a fish, as having no voice.
But Theophrastus, in his book on The Laughable, says that this was a
proverb originating with Stratonicus, but applied to Simmychas the
actor; for that he uttered the proverb, dividing the words distinctly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: Megas oudeis sapros ichthys">μέγας οὐδεὶς σαπρὸς ἰχθῦς</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his Constitution of the Naxians, speaks thus of this
proverb&mdash;"Of the rich men among the Naxians, the greater part lived
in the city, but the remainder lived scattered about in the villages.
Accordingly, in one of these villages, the name of which was Lestad&aelig;,
Telestagoras lived, a man of great riches and of very high reputation,
and greatly honoured by the people in other respects, and also with
daily presents which they used to send him. And whenever people from
the city, going down to the market, wanted to drive a hard bargain for
anything they wished to purchase, the sellers would say that they would
rather give it to Telestagoras than sell it for such a price as was
offered. So some young men, buying a large fish, when the fisherman
made this speech, being annoyed at hearing this so often, having
already drunk a good deal, went to his house to sup; and Telestagoras
received them in a very friendly and hospitable manner, but the young
men insulted him, and his two marriageable daughters. At which the
Naxians were very indignant, and took up arms and attacked the young
men; and there was a great sedition, Lygdamis being the leader of the
Naxians, who, having got the chief command in this sedition, became the
tyrant of his country."</p>

<p>41. And I do not think it unseasonable myself, since I have
mentioned the harp-player Stratonicus, to say something also concerning
his readiness in repartee. For when he was teaching people to play the
harp, and as he had in his school nine statues of the nine Muses, and
one of Apollo, and had also two pupils, when some one asked him how
many pupils he had, he said, "Gods and all, twelve." And once when he
had travelled to Mylassa, and saw there a great number of temples,
but very few citizens, standing in the middle of the forum, he cried
out&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: Akouete naoi">᾿ακούετε ναοί</ins>.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
</div>

<p>And Macho has recorded some memorials of him in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Once Stratonicus travell'd down to Pella,<br />
And having heard from many men before<br />
That the baths of that city were accustom'd<br />
To give the bathers spleen; and finding, too,<br />
That many of the youths did exercise<br />
Before the fire, who preserved their colour<br />
And vigour of their body unimpair'd;<br />
He said that those who told him so were wrong.<br />
But finding afterwards, when he left the bath,<br />
A man whose spleen was twice his belly's size,&mdash;<br />
"This man," said he, "appears to me here now<br />
To sit and keep the garments of the men<br />
Who go to bathe, and all their spleens beside,<br />
That all the people may have room enough."<br />
A miserable singer once did give<br />
A feast to Stratonicus and his friends,<br />
And, while the cup was freely going round,<br />
Exhibited his art to all the company.<br />
And as the feast was rich and liberal,<br />
Poor Stratonicus, wearied with the song,<br />
And having no one near him he could speak to,<br />
Knock'd down his cup, and asked for a larger.<br />
And when he'd drunk full many a draught, he made<br />
A last libation to the glorious sun,<br />
And then composed himself to sleep, and left<br />
The rest to fortune. Presently more guests<br />
Came, as good luck would have it, to the singer,<br />
To feast with him; still Stratonicus slept,<br />
Heavy with wine; and when they ask'd him why<br />
A man so much accustom'd to drink wine<br />
Had been so soon o'ercome by drink this day,<br />
"This treacherous, cursed singing man," said he,<br />
"Treated me like a bullock in a stall;<br />
For first he fed me up, and then he kill'd me."<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 550]</span>

Once Stratonicus to Abdera went,<br />
To see some games which there were celebrated;<br />
And seeing every separate citizen<br />
Having a private crier to himself,<br />
And each of them proclaiming a new moon<br />
Whene'er he pleased, so that the criers were<br />
Quite out of all proportion to the citizens,<br />
He walk'd about on tiptoes through the city,<br />
Looking intently on the ground beneath.<br />
And when some stranger ask'd him what had happen'd<br />
To his feet, to make him look so gravely at them:&mdash;<br />
He said, "I'm very well all over, friend,<br />
And can run faster to an entertainment<br />
Than any parasite; but I'm in fear<br />
Lest I should tread by hazard on some <ins title="Greek: kêryx">κῆρυξ</ins>,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br />
And pierce my foot with its spikes and lame myself."<br />
<span class="linespace1">Once, when a wretched flute-player was preparing</span><br />
To play the flute at a sacred festival,<br />
"Let us have only sounds of omen good,"<br />
Said Stratonicus; "let us pour libations<br />
And pray devoutly to the mighty gods."<br />
<span class="linespace1">There was a harper, and his name was Cleon,</span><br />
But he was nicknamed Ox; he sang most vilely<br />
Without th' accompaniment of the lyre.<br />
When Stratonicus heard him, then he said,<br />
"I've often heard of asses at the lyre,<br />
But now I see an ox in the same case."<br />
<span class="linespace1">The harper Stratonicus once had sail'd</span><br />
To Pontus, to see king Berisades.<br />
And when he'd staid in Pontus long enough,<br />
He thought he would return again to Greece.<br />
But when the king refused to let him go,<br />
They say that Stratonicus said to him&mdash;<br />
"Why, do you mean to stay here long yourself?"<br />
<span class="linespace1">The harper Stratonicus once was staying</span><br />
Some time at Corinth; when an aged woman<br />
One day stood looking at him a long time,<br />
And would not take her eyes off: then said he,<br />
"Tell me, I pray you, in God's name, good mother,<br />
What is't you wish, and why you look thus on me?"<br />
"I marvell'd," said she, "how 'twas your mother<br />
Held you nine months, without her belly bursting,<br />
While this town can't endure you one whole day."<br />
<span class="linespace1">Fair Biothea, Nicotheon's wife,</span><br />
Once at a party with a handmaid fair<br />
Made some strange noise; and after that, by chance,<br />
She trod upon a Sicyonian almond.<br />
Then Stratonicus said, "The noise is different."<br />
But when night came, for this heedless word,<br />
He wash'd out his free-speaking in the sea.<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">STRATONICUS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
<div class="topspace-1">

<span class="linespace1">Once, when at Ephesus, as rumour goes,</span><br />
A stupid harper was exhibiting<br />
One of his pupils to a band of friends;<br />
Stratonicus, who by chance was present, said,<br />
"He cannot make himself a harp-player,<br />
And yet he tries to teach the art to others."
</div>
</div>

<p>42. And Clearchus, in the second book of his treatise on Friendship,
says,&mdash;"Stratonicus the harp-player, whenever he wished to go to sleep,
used to order a slave to bring him something to drink; 'not,' says
he, 'because I am thirsty now, but that I may not be presently.'" And
once, at Byzantium, when a harp-player had played his prelude well,
but had made a blunder of the rest of the performance, he got up and
made proclamation, "That whoever would point out the harp-player who
had played the prelude should receive a thousand drachm&aelig;." And when
he was once asked by some one who were the wickedest people, he said,
"That in Pamphylia, the people of Phaselis were the worst; but that
the Sidet&aelig; were the worst in the whole world." And when he was asked
again, according to the account given by Hegesander, which were the
greatest barbarians, the B&oelig;otians or the Thessalians, he said, "The
Eleans." And once he erected a trophy in his school, and put this
inscription on it&mdash;"Over the bad harp-players." And once, being asked
by some one which was the safer kind of vessel, the long one or the
round one,&mdash;"Those," quoth he, "are the safest which are in dock." And
once he made a display of his art at Rhodes, and no one applauded; on
which he left the theatre, and when he had got into the air he said,
"When you fail to give what costs you nothing, how can I expect any
solid pay from you?" "Let the Eleans," said he, "celebrate gymnastic
contests, and let the Corinthians establish choral, and the Athenians
theatrical exhibitions; and if any one of them does anything wrong, let
the Laced&aelig;monians be scourged,"&mdash;jesting upon the public scourgings
exhibited in that city, as Charicles relates, in the first book of his
treatise on the City Contests. And when Ptolemy the king was talking
with him in an ambitious kind of way about harp-playing, "The sceptre,"
said he, "O king, is one thing, and the plectrum another;" as Capito
the epic poet says in the fourth book of his Commentaries addressed to
Philopappus. And once being invited to hear a flute-player, after he
had heard him, he said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 552]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
The father granted half his prayer,<br />
The other half denied.
</div>

<p>And when some one asked him which half he granted, he said, "He granted
to him to play very badly, and denied him the ability to sing well."
And once, when a beam fell down and slew some wicked man, "O Men," said
he, "I think (<ins title="Greek: dokô">δοκῶ</ins>) there are gods; and if not, there are
beams (<ins title="Greek: dokoi">δόκοι</ins>)."</p>

<p>43. Also, after the before-mentioned witticisms of Stratonicus, he put
down besides a list of these things following.</p>

<p>Stratonicus said once to the father of Chrysogonus, when he was saying
that he had everything at home in great abundance, for that he himself
had undertaken the works, and that of his sons, one could teach<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and another play the flute; "You still," said Stratonicus, "want one
thing." And when the other asked him what that was, "You want," said
he, "a theatre in your house." And when some one asked him why he kept
travelling over the whole of Greece, and did not remain in one city, he
said&mdash;"That he had received from the Muses all the Greeks as his wages,
from whom he was to levy a tax to atone for their ignorance." And he
said that Phaon did not play harmony,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
but Cadmus. And when Phaon pretended to great skill on the flute, and
said that he had a chorus at Megara, "You are joking," said he; "for
you do not possess anything there, but you are possessed yourself."
And he said&mdash;"That he marvelled above all things at the mother of
Satyrus the Sophist, because she had borne for nine months a man whom
no city in all Greece could bear for nine days." And once, hearing that
he had arrived in Ilium at the time of the Ilian games, "There are,"
said he, "always troubles in Ilium." And when Minnacus was disputing
with him about music, he said&mdash;"That he was not attending to what
he said, because he had got in above his ankles." At another time he
said of a bad physician&mdash;"That he made those who were attended
by him go to the shades below the very day they came to him." And
having met one of his acquaintances, when he saw his sandals carefully
sponged, he pitied him as being badly off, pretending to think that he
would never have had his sandals so well sponged if he had not sponged
them himself. And as it was a very mixed
race of people who lived at Teichius, a town in the Milesian territory,
when he saw that all the tombs about were those of foreigners, "Let us
begone, O boy," said he; "for all the strangers, as it seems, die here,
and none of the citizens." And when Zethus the harper was giving a
lecture upon music, he said that he was the only person who was utterly
unfit to discuss the subject of music, inasmuch as he had chosen the
most unmusical of all names, and called himself Zethus<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
instead of Amphion. And once, when he was teaching some Macedonian to
play on the harp, being angry that he did nothing as he ought, he said,
"Go to Macedonia."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">STRATONICUS.</div>

<p>44. And when he saw the shrine of some hero splendidly adorned, close
to a cold and worthless bathing-house, when he came out, having had
a very bad bath, "I do not wonder," said he, "that many tablets are
dedicated here; for every one of the bathers naturally offers one, as
having been saved from drowning." And at another time he said&mdash;"In &AElig;nus
there are eight months of cold and four of winter." At another time
he said, "that the people of Pontus had come out of a great sea"&mdash;as
though he had said (great) trouble. And he called the Rhodians White
Cyren&aelig;ans, and the city he called the City of Suitors; and Heraclea he
called the Man-Corinth; and Byzantium he called the Arm-pit of Greece;
and the Leucadians were Stale Corinthians; and the Ambraciotes he
called Membraciotes. And when he had gone out of the gates of Heraclea,
and was looking round him, when some one asked him what he was looking
at, he said that "he was ashamed of being seen, as if he were coming
out of a brothel." And once, seeing two men bound in the stocks, he
said&mdash;"This is suited to the disposition of a very insignificant city,
not to be able to fill such a place as this." And once he said to a man
who professed to be a musician, but who had been a gardener before, and
who was disputing with him about harmony,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let each man sing the art in which he's skill'd.
</div>

<p>And once at Maronea, when he was drinking with some people, he
said,&mdash;"That he could tell in what part of the city he was, if men led
him through it blindfold;" and then when they did so lead him, and
asked him where he was, "Near the eating-house," said he, because all
Maronea seemed a mere eating-house. And once, when he was sitting

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 554]</span>

next to Telephanes, and he was beginning to blow the flute, he said,
"Higher, like men who belch." And when the bathing-man in Cardia
brought him some bad earth and salt water to cleanse himself with, he
said that he was being besieged both by land and sea.</p>

<p>45. And when he had conquered his competitors at Sicyon, he set up a
trophy in the temple of &AElig;sculapius, and wrote upon it, "Stratonicus,
conqueror of those who played badly on the harp." And when some one had
sung, he asked what tune he had been singing; and when he said that it
was an air of Carcinus,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
"More like that," said he, "than the air of a man." He also said, on
another occasion, that there was no spring at Maronea, only heat. And
once at Phaselis, when the bathing-man was wrangling with his boy about
the money, (for the law was that foreigners should pay more for bathing
than natives,) "Oh, you wretched boy!" said he, "you have almost made
me a citizen of Phaselis, to save a halfpenny." And once, when a person
was praising him in hopes to get something by it, he said, "that he
himself was a greater beggar." And once, when he was teaching in a
small town, he said, "This is not a city (<ins title="Greek: polis">πόλις</ins>), but hardly
one (<ins title="Greek: molis">πόλις</ins>)." And once, when he was at Pella, he came to a
well, and asked whether it was fit to drink; and when those who were
drawing water from it said, "At all events we drink it;" "Then," said
he, "I am sure it is not fit to drink:" for the men happened to be very
sallow-looking. And when he had heard the poem of Timotheus, on the
subject of Semele in Labour, he said, "But if she had brought forth an
artisan, and not a god, what sounds would she have uttered!"</p>

<p>And when Polyidas was giving himself airs, because his pupil Philotas
had beaten Timotheus, he said, "That he wondered at his being so
ignorant as not to know that he makes decrees, and Timotheus laws."
And he said to Areus the harp-player, who was annoying him, "Play to
the crows."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
And once he was at Sicyon, when a leather-dresser was
abusing him, and he said to the leather-dresser (<ins title="Greek: nakodepsês">νακοδέψης</ins>),
"O you <ins title="Greek: kakodaimon nakodaimon">κακόδαιμον νακόδαιμον</ins>." And Stratonicus himself,
beholding the Rhodians dissolved in luxury, and drinking only warm
drinks, said, "that there were white Cyren&aelig;ans." And he
called Rhodes itself the City of the Suitors,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
thinking that they were in no respect different from the
Cyren&aelig;ans in debauchery, but only in complexion; and also because
of the devotion to pleasure of the inhabitants, he compared Rhodes
itself to the city of the Suitors.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ARISTOTLE.</div>

<p>46. And Stratonicus was, in all these elaborate witticisms, an imitator
of Simonides the poet, as Ephorus tells us in the second book of his
treatise on Inventions; who says that Philoxenus of Cythera was also a
great studier of the same pursuit. And Ph&aelig;nias the Peripatetic, in the
second book of his treatise on Poets, says&mdash;"Stratonicus the Athenian
appears to have been the first person who introduced the system of
playing chords into the simple harp-playing; and he was the first man
who ever took pupils in music, and who ever composed tables of music.
And he was also a man of no small brilliancy as a wit." He says also
that he was eventually put to death by Nicocles, the King of the
Cyprians, on account of the freedom of his witticisms, being compelled
to drink poison, because he had turned the sons of the king into
ridicule.</p>

<p>47. But I marvel at Aristotle, whom these wise men, my excellent
Democritus, are so incessantly speaking of and praising, (and whose
writings you also esteem highly, as you do those of the other
philosophers and orators,) on account of his great accuracy: and I
should like to know when he learnt, or from what Proteus or Nereus
who came up from the depths he found out, what fish do, or how they
go to sleep, or how they live: for all these things he has told us in
his writings, so as to be, in the words of the comic poets, "a wonder
to fools;" for he says that the ceryx, and indeed that the whole
race of shell-fish, are propagated without copulation; and that the
purple-fish and the ceryx are longlived. For how could he know that
the purple-fish lives six years? and how could he know that the viper
takes a long time to propagate his species? or that of all its tribe
the longest at that work is the pigeon, the next the &oelig;nas, and the
quickest is the turtle-dove? And whence did he learn that the horse
lives five-and-thirty years, but the mare more than forty? saying, too,
that some have lived even seventy-five years. And he also states that
from the copulation of lice there are born nits; and that from a worm,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 556]</span>

after its change, there is produced a caterpillar, from which comes
the humble-bee, and from that the larva of the silk-worm. And he also
says that bees live to six years of age, and that some live even seven
years; and he says that neither bee nor wasp have ever been seen in the
act of copulation, on which account no one can ever tell whether they
are male or female. And from what did he learn that men are inferior
to bees? for these latter always preserve an equal condition of life,
being subject to no changes, but employing themselves without ceasing
in the collection of honey, and doing that without having been taught
by any one to do so: but men are inferior to bees, and as full of fancy
as bees are of honey: how, then, has Aristotle observed all these
things? And in his treatise on Long Life, he says that a fly has been
seen which had lived six or seven years. But what proof is there of
this?</p>

<p>48. And where did he ever see ivy growing out of a stag's head? And
again, owls and night-jars, he says, cannot see by day; on which
account they hunt for their food by night, and they do this not during
the whole night, but at the beginning of evening. And he says, too,
that there are several different kinds of eyes, for some are blue, and
some are black, and some are hazel. He says, too, that the eyes of men
are of different characters, and that the differences of disposition
may be judged of from the eyes; for that those men who have goats'
eyes, are exceedingly sharp-sighted, and have the best dispositions.
And of others, he says that some men have projecting eyes, and some
have eyes deeply set, and some keep a mean between the two: and those
whose eyes are deeply set, he says, have the sharpest sight, and
those whose eyes project, must have the worst dispositions; and those
who are moderate in these respects, are people, says he, of moderate
dispositions. There are also some people whose eyes are always winking,
and some who never wink at all, and some who do so in a moderate
degree: and those who are always winking are shameless<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
people, and those who never wink at all are unstable and fickle, and
those who wink in a moderate degree have the best disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 557]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ARISTOTLE'S NATURAL HISTORY.</div>

<p>He says also that man is the only animal which has its heart on the
left side; and that all other animals have it in the middle of the
body. And he says that males have more teeth than females; and he
affirms that this has been noticed in the case of the sheep, and of the
pig, and of the goat. And he says also that there is no fish which has
testicles, and there is no fish which has a breast, and no bird either;
but that the only fish which has no gall is the dolphin. There are,
however, some, says he, which have no gall in their liver, but they
have it near their bowels; as the sturgeon, the synagris, the lamprey,
the sword-fish, and the sea-swallow. But the amia has its gall spread
over the whole of its entrails: and the hawk and the kite have theirs
spread both over their liver and their entrails; but the &aelig;gocephalus
has his gall both in his liver and in his stomach: and the pigeon, and
the quail, and the swallow have theirs, some in their entrails, and
some in their stomach.</p>

<p>49. Moreover, he says that all the molluscous fish, and the shell-fish,
and the cartilaginous fish, and all insects, spend a long time in
copulation; but that the dolphin and some other fish copulate lying
alongside the female. And he says that the dolphins are very slow,
but fish in general very quick. Again he says that the lion has very
solid bones, and that if they are struck, fire comes from them as from
flint stones. And that the dolphin has bones, but no spine; but that
cartilaginous fish have both gristle and spine. And of animals he says
that some are terrestrial and some aquatic; and that some even live in
the fire; and that there are some, which he calls ephemera, which live
only one day: and that there are some which are amphibious, such as the
river-horse, and the crocodile, and the otter. And that all animals in
general have two forefeet, but that the crab has four; and that all the
animals which have blood are either without feet at all, or are bipeds,
or quadrupeds; and that all the animals which have more than four feet
are destitute of blood: on which account every animal which moves,
moves by what he calls four tokens,&mdash;man by two hands and two feet, a
bird by two feet and two wings, an eel and a conger by two fins and
two joints. Moreover, some animals have hands, as a man has, and some
appear to have hands, as a monkey does; for there is no brute beast
which can really give and take, and it is for those things that hands

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 558]</span>

are given to men as instruments. Again, some animals have limbs, as a
man, an ox, an ass; and some have no limbs, as a serpent, an oyster,
the pulmo marinus. There are also many animals which are not always
visible, such as those which hide in holes; and those which do not hide
in holes are still not always visible, as swallows and cranes.</p>

<p>50. And though I could repeat to you now a great deal of nonsense
which the medicine-seller talked, I forbear to do so, although I know
that Epicurus, that most truthful of men, said of him in his letter
about Institutions, that he devoted himself to a military life after
having squandered his patrimony in gluttony; and that, turning out an
indifferent soldier, he then took to selling medicines. Then, when the
school of Plato was opened, he says, he changed again, and applied
himself to philosophical discussions, and as he was not a man destitute
of ability, by little and little he became a speculative philosopher.
I know, too, that Epicurus is the only person who ever said this of
him; for neither did Eubulides nor Cephisodorus venture to say anything
of the kind against the Stagirite, and that, too, though they did
write books against him. But in that same letter Epicurus says, that
Protagoras also, who became a philosopher from having been a porter and
a wood-carrier, was first promoted to be an amanuensis of Democritus;
who, wondering at the admirable way in which he used to put the wood
together, took him under his eye in consequence of this beginning; and
then he began to teach the rudiments of learning in some village, and
after that he proceeded on to the study of philosophy. And I now, O
fellow feasters, after all this conversation, feel a great desire for
something to eat. And when some one said that the cooks were already
preparing something, and taking care that the dishes should not be
served up cold, on account of the excessive length to which the "feast
of words" had been carried, for that no one could eat cold dishes,
Cynulcus said,&mdash;But I, like the Milcon of Alexis, the comic poet, can
eat them even if they are not served up warm&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And it was not without some cleverness that Sph&aelig;rus, who was a
fellow-pupil with Chrysippus in the school of Cleanthes, when he had
been sent for to Alexandria by king Ptolemy; when on one occasion birds
made of wax were served up at a banquet, and he was putting out his
hand to take some, but was stopped by the king, who told him that he
was assenting to a sham; very appropriately answered,&mdash;"That he did
not agree that they were birds at all, but only that it was probable
that they might be birds; and that an opinion which could be confirmed
by the perception, is superior to that which is merely probable; for
that the one cannot be incorrect, but that what is probable may turn
out contrary to what was expected." And so it could not be a bad thing
if some waxen dishes were brought round to us too, according to our
perceptive opinions, so that we might be beguiled at least by the sight
of them, and so escape talking on for ever.</p>

<p>51. And when they were now on the point of sitting down to eat again,
Daphnus bade them stop, quoting this iambic out of the Mammacythus or

<p>And indeed, said he, I say that the discussion about fish is still
defective in some points, since the sons of &AElig;sculapius (such as
Philotimus I mean, in his essay on Food, and Mnesitheus the Athenian,
and Diphilus the Siphnian) have said a good deal about fishes, of which
we have as yet taken no notice. For Diphilus, in his work entitled A
Treatise on Food fit for People in Health and Invalids, says,&mdash;"Of
sea-fish, those which keep to the rocks are easily digested, and juicy,
and purgative, and light, but not very nutritious; but those which keep
in the deep water are much less digestible, very nutritious, but apt
to disagree with one. Now, of the fish which keep to the rocks, the
phycen and the phycis are very tender little fish, and very digestible;
but the perch, which is like them, varies a little as to the places in
which it is found. And the tench resembles the perch; but the smaller
tench and the white ones are tender, juicy, and digestible; but the
green ones (and they are also called caulin&aelig;) are dry, and devoid of
juice. The chann&aelig; also have tender meat, but still they are harder than
the perch. Then there is the scarus, which has tender flesh, not very
firm, sweet, light, digestible, not apt to disagree with one, and good

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 560]</span>

for the stomach. But the fresh ones are less popular than the others,
because they hunt the sea-hares and feed on them, owing to which their
entrails are apt to produce cholera morbus. And the fish which is
called ceris is tender, good for the bowels, and good for the stomach;
but its juice has fattening and purgative qualities. The orphus, which
some write <ins title="Greek: orphos">ὀρφὸς</ins>, and some <ins title="Greek: orphôs">ὀρφὼς</ins>, is very full of
a pleasant juice, glutinous, indigestible, very nutritious, diuretic.
But the parts near his head are glutinous and digestible; but the more
fleshy parts are indigestible and heavy, and the part towards the
tail is the tenderest part; and he is a fish apt to generate phlegm,
and indigestible. The sphyr&aelig;n&aelig; are more nutritious than the congers;
and the eel caught in lakes is not so nice as the sea-eel, but it is
more nutritious. The chrysophrys is very like the melanurus; and the
sea-scorpions, which are found in the deep sea, and are of a tawny
colour, are more nutritious than those which are found in marshes, or
than the large ones which are taken on the shores.</p>

<p>52. "But the sparus is harsh-tasted, tender, with no unpleasant
smell, good for the stomach, diuretic, and not indigestible; but when
he is fried he is indigestible. The mullet is good for the stomach,
very astringent, of very firm flesh, not very digestible, apt to bind
the bowels, especially when it is broiled; but when it is fried in a
frying-pan, then it is heavy and indigestible; and, as a general rule,
the whole tribe of mullets has the property of causing secretions of
blood. The synodon and the charax are of the same kind, but the charax
is the better of the two. The phagrus is found both in the river
and in the sea; but that which is found in the sea is the best. The
capriscus is called also the mussel; but it has a strong smell, and
very hard meat, and it is more indigestible than the citharus; but its
skin is very pleasant to the taste. The needle-fish, or belone, and
it is also called the ablennes, is indigestible and moist, but good
for the bowels. The thrissa, and those of the same kind, such as the
chalcis and the eretimis, are very digestible. The cestreus is found
in the sea, and in rivers, and in lakes. And this fish, says he, is
also called the oxyrhynchus; but the one which is taken in the Nile is
called the coracinus. And the black kind is smaller than the white, and
when boiled it is not so good as when it is roasted; for when roasted
it is good for the stomach and good for the bowels. The salpe is
hard-fleshed, and unpleasant to the taste, but the best are those which
are caught at Alexandria, and those which are taken in the autumn. For
it is white, full of moisture, and free from any unpleasant smell. The
gryllus is like the eel in appearance, but it is not nice to the taste.
The sea-hawk is harder than the sea-cuckoo, but in other respects they
are much alike. The uranoscopus, and also the fish called agnus, which
is also called the callionymus, are heavy fish. The boax, when boiled,
is very digestible, giving out a very wholesome juice, and is good for
the stomach; and that which is broiled on the coals is sweeter and more
tender. The bacchus is full of abundant and agreeable and wholesome
juice, and is very nutritious. The sea-goat is not very agreeable as
to its juice, not very digestible, and has a disagreeable smell. The
sea-sparrow and the buglossus are both nutritious and palatable, and
the turbot is like them. The sea-grayling, the cephalus, the cestreus,
the myxinus, and the colon are all much alike as to their eatable
properties; but the cestreus is inferior to the cephalus, the myxinus
is worse, and the colon is the least good of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 561]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>53. "The thynnis and the thynnus are both heavy and nutritious; but
the fish which is called the Acarnanian is sweet, very exciting, very
nutritious, and easily secreted. The anchovy is heavy and indigestible,
and the white kind is called the cobitis; and the hepsetus, a little
fish, is of the same genus.</p>

<p>"Of cartilaginous fish, the sea-cow is fleshy, but the shark is
superior to that,&mdash;that kind, I mean, which is called the asterias.
But the alopecias, or sea-fox, is in taste very like the land animal,
from which circumstance, indeed, it has its name. The ray is a very
delicate fish to the taste; but the stellated ray is tenderer still,
and full of excellent juice; but the smooth ray is less wholesome for
the stomach, and has an unpleasant smell. But the torpedo, which is
hard of digestion, is in the parts below the head very tender, and good
for the stomach, and, moreover, very digestible, but its other parts
are not so; and the small ones are the best, especially when they are
plain boiled. The rhinè, which is one of the cartilaginous class, is
very digestible and light; but those of the largest size are the most
nutritious; and, as a general rule, all the cartilaginous fish are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 562]</span>

apt to create flatulence, and are fleshy, and difficult of digestion,
and if they are eaten in any quantity, they are bad for the eyes. The
cuttle-fish, when boiled, is tender, palatable, and digestible, and
also good for the stomach; but the juice which comes from it has the
property of making the blood thin, and is apt to cause secretions
by h&aelig;morrhoids. The squid is more digestible, and is nutritious,
especially the small-sized one; but when boiled they are harder, and
not palatable. The polypus promotes amativeness, but it is hard and
indigestible; and those of the largest size are the most nutritious,
and when they are much boiled, they have a tendency to fill the stomach
with liquid, and they bind the bowels. And Alexis, in his Pamphila,
points out the useful properties of the polypus, speaking as follows,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But if you are in love, O Cteson,<br />
What is more useful than these fish I bring?<br />
Ceryces, cockles, (onions too, are here,)<br />
The mighty polypus, and good-sized turbot.
</div>

<p>"The pelamys also is very nutritious and heavy, it is also diuretic,
and very indigestible; but when cured like the callubium, it is quite
as good for the stomach, and it has a tendency to make the blood
thin; and the large kind is called the synodontis. The sea-swallow,
or chelidonias, is also something like the pelamys, but harder; and
the chelidon is like the polypus, and emits juice which purifies the
complexion, and stirs up the blood. The orcynus is a fish who delights
in the mud; and the larger kind is like the chelidonias in hardness,
but the lower part of its abdomen and its collar-bone are palatable and
tender; but those which are called cost&aelig;, when cured and salted, are a
middling fish. The xanthias has rather a strong smell, and is tenderer
than the orcynus." These are the statements of Diphilus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 563]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FISH.</div>

<p>54. But Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his treatise on Eatables,
says,&mdash;"The larger breed of fishes are called by some sectile, and by
others sea-fish; as, for instance, the chrysophrys, the sea-grayling,
and the phagrus. And these are all difficult of digestion, but when
they are digested they supply a great deal of nourishment. And the
whole class of scaly fish, such as the thynni, the scombri, the
tunnies, the congers, and all of those kinds, are also gregarious. But
those which are not seen
by themselves, nor in large shoals, are the most digestible, such
as the congers, and the carchari&aelig;, and fish of that kind. But the
gregarious kinds of fish of that sort are very pleasant to the palate,
for they are fat; but they are heavy, and difficult of digestion, on
which account they are very good for curing; and, indeed, these kinds
make the best cured fish of all; they are also very good roasted, for
by that process their fatty parts are got rid of. But those kinds which
are skinned before they are dressed, as a general rule, are those fish
which have a rough outside to their skin, not of scales, but such
as rays and rhin&aelig; have. And all these kinds are easily divided into
small pieces, but they have not a sweet smell. And they supply the
body with plenty of moist nourishment, and of all boiled fish they
have the greatest effect on the bowels; but when they are roasted
they are not so good. And the whole class of molluscous fish, such as
polypi and cuttle-fish, and others like them, are very indigestible,
on which account they are very serviceable in exciting the amatory
passions. They are also calculated to cause flatulence; and the time of
indulgence in amatory pleasures requires a flatulent habit of body. All
these fish are better when boiled. For their juices are injurious, and
you may see what juices they emit when they are washed; and the boiling
extracts all these juices from their flesh. For as the heat which is
applied in boiling is a gradual one, and conjoined with moisture, there
is, as it were, a sort of washing of them. But when they are roasted,
that dries up the moisture, and moreover, as their flesh is hard by
nature, it is natural that it should be made more so in this way.</p>

<p>55. "But anchovies of all kinds, and membrades, and trichides, and
all the other little fish which we eat backbones and all, make the
digestion flatulent, and give a good deal of moist nutriment. And
so, as the digestion is unequal, the flesh being digested with great
rapidity, and the bones dissolving slowly, for the anchovies are very
bony of themselves, the digestion of the one part hinders the digestion
of the other, and so flatulence arises from the digestion, and moisture
comes from the quantity of nourishment. They are better when they are
boiled, but still they have very unequal effects on the bowels. The
fish which keep close to the rocks, such as tench, and scorpions,
and sea-sparrows, and others of the same kind, supply a dry kind of
nourishment to our bodies, but they are light and nutritious, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 564]</span>

are easily digested, and leave nothing behind them, and are not apt
to cause flatulence. And every kind of fish is more digestible when
dressed simply, and especially those which keep near the rocks have a
better flavour when dressed plainly. And the species which is called
soft-fleshed is like them, namely, the sea-thrush, the sea-blackbird,
and others which resemble them. And these contain more moisture than
the others, and with respect to refreshing the strength of those who
eat them, they have more efficacy. And if any one wishes to produce an
effect upon his bowels, he should eat them boiled; but if he is in good
health, then he will find them nutritious roasted. And as diuretic food
they are equally useful cooked either way.</p>

<p>56. "But the places of the sea where rivers and lakes fall into it,
and also those where there are large bays and gulfs of the sea, are
those where all the fish are more juicy, and more full of fat. They are
also more palatable when caught in those places, but less nutritious
and less digestible. And on the shore where it is exposed to the open
sea, and where it is unprotected, then the fishes found there are for
the most part hard and thin, beaten by the continued action of the
waves. But where the sea is deep close in shore and less exposed to
violent winds, especially if there are any cities near, then there is
the greatest number of fish, and they are equally excellent in respect
of pleasantness of flavour and ease of digestion, and also in the
nourishment which they afford to the body. But of sea fish those are
the most indigestible and the heaviest which migrate at certain seasons
from the sea to the lakes and rivers; such as the cestreus; and as a
general rule that is the character of every fish which can live in
both salt and fresh water. But of those which live wholly in rivers
and lakes, the river fish are the best; for the water of lakes is more
apt to putrefy. And, again, of river fish those are the best which are
found in the most rapid rivers; and especially the trout; for those are
never found except where the river is rapid and cold, and they are far
superior to all other river fish in their digestible properties."</p>

<p>And, indeed, I myself am not so violently fond of fish as the man in
the Butalion of the same poet. (And that play is an amended edition of
one of the Countryman's characters.) And he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> And I to-day will give a feast to all of you;</span><br />
And take you money now, and buy the supper.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Yes; for unless I've money I should hardly</span><br />
Know how to buy discreetly. But i' the first place,<br />
Tell me what food, what dishes you prefer.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> All kinds of food.</span><br />
<span class="linespace6_5"><i>B.</i> But tell me separately.</span><br />
First now, should you approve of any fish?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> A fishmonger came once into the country</span><br />
With a good basketfull of sprats and triglides,<br />
And, by Jove, greatly he pleased all of us.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Well, tell me then, should you now like some fish?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Indeed I should, if they were very little.</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> 'Tis plain enough that it is Helen's food</span>
This fellow means, just sprats and triglides.
</div>

<p>And in his Countryman he also calls sprats and triglides the food of
Hecate. And Ephippus too, disparaging small fish, in his Philyra,
speaks as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> My father, would you like to go to market</span><br />
And buy some fish for me?<br />
<span class="linespace10_5"><i>B.</i> What shall I buy?</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Do not you yet know all the worth of money?</span>
</div>

<p>58. And in the same poet, in his Spit-bearers, there is a very witty
young man who disparages everything connected with the purchase of
fish. And he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> But while you buy, don't disregard economy,</span><br />

<span class="linespace8"><i>B.</i> Just tell me how.</span><br />

Some eels will look nice too upon the table&mdash;<br />

<p>And in Mnesimachus, the Morose Man, in the play of the same name, being
a great miser, says to the extravagant young man in the play&mdash;</p>

<p>59. But since, as fortune would have it so, in the before-quoted
lines,&mdash;my excellent Ulpian, or you too, O you sons of grammarians,
just tell me what was Ephippus's meaning in what I have just repeated,
when he said&mdash;</p>

<p>For I think there is here an allusion to some historical fact, and I
should like to understand it. And Plutarch said,&mdash;There is a Rhodian
tale, which, however, I can hardly repeat at the moment, because it
is a very long time since I have fallen in with the book in which it
occurs. But I know that Phoenix the Colophonian, the Iambic poet,
making mention of some men as collecting money for the Jackdaw, speaks
as follows&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 567]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE SWALLOW.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
My friends, I pray you give a handful now<br />
Of barley to the jackdaw, Phoebus' daughter;<br />
Or else a plate of wheat; or else a loaf,<br />
A halfpenny, or whatsoe'er you please;<br />
Give, my good friends, whatever you can spare<br />
To the poor jackdaw; e'en a grain of salt;<br />
For willingly she feeds on anything;<br />
And he who salt bestows to-day, to-morrow<br />
May give some honey. Open, boy, the door;<br />
Plutus has heard, and straight a serving maid<br />
Brings out some figs. Gods, let that maiden be<br />
For ever free from harm, and may she find<br />
A wealthy husband of distinguish'd name:<br />
And may she show unto her aged father<br />
A lusty boy, and on her mother's lap<br />
Place a fair girl, her daughter, to bring up<br />
A happy helpmate for some lucky cousin.<br />
But I, where'er my feet conduct my eyes,<br />
Sing with alternate melody at the gates<br />
Of him who gives, and him who rude denies.<br />
At present I'll leave off, and say no more.
</div>

<p>And at the end of this set of iambics he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But you, my friends, who have good store at home,<br />
Give something. Give, O king; give you too, housewife.<br />
It is the law that all should give their hand<br />

Give what you please, and it shall be sufficient.

<p>And those people who went about collecting for the jackdaw (<ins title="Greek: korônê">κορώνη</ins>)
were called Coronist&aelig;, as Pamphilus of Alexandria tells us, in
his treatise on Names. And the songs which are sung by them are called
coronismata, as Agnocles the Rhodian tells us, in his Coronist&aelig;.</p>

<p>60. There is also another collection made among the Rhodians, the
making of which is called <ins title="Greek: chelidonizein">χελιδονίζειν</ins>; and it is mentioned
by Theognis, in the second book of his treatise on the Sacrifices in
Rhodes, where he writes thus&mdash;"There is a species of collecting which
the Rhodians call <ins title="Greek: chelidonizein">χελιδονίζειν</ins>, which takes place in the
month Boedromion. And it derives its name of <ins title="Greek: chelidonizein">χελιδονίζειν</ins>
because the people are accustomed to utter the following song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The swallow, the swallow (<ins title="Greek: chelidôn">χελιδών</ins>) is come,<br />

Or e'en your wife who sits within the house.<br />
She is but little, we shall find her light.<br />
If you give something, let it be worth having.<br />
Open, then, open the door to the swallow,<br />
For we are not old men, but only boys.

<p>And Cleobulus the Lindian was the first man who introduced the custom
of this collection, at a time when there was a great want in Lindus of
a collection of money.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EPHESUS.</div>

<p>61. But, since we have mentioned the Rhodian histories, I myself am
now going to tell you something about fish, from the account given of
the beautiful Rhodes, which that delightful writer Lynceus says is
full of excellent fish. Ergias the Rhodian, then, in his Account of
his own Country, having first made mention of the Phoenicians, who
inhabited the island, says&mdash;"That Phalanthus, and his friends, having a
very strong city in Ialysus, called Achaia, and being very economical
of their provisions, held out for a long time against Iphiclus, who
besieged them. For they had also a prophecy given them by some oracle,
that they should keep the place till crows became white, and till
fish were seen in their goblets. They therefore, expecting that these
things would never happen, prosecuted the war with less vigour. But
Iphiclus, having heard from some one of the oracles of the Phoenicians,
and having waylaid a highly-trusted adherent of Phalanthus, whose
name was Larcas, as he was going for water, and having entered into a
covenant with him, caught some fish at the spring, and putting them
into the ewer, gave them to Larcas, and bade him carry the water back,
and pour it into the goblet from which he was used to pour out wine
for Phalanthus: and he did so. And Iphiclus also caught some crows,
and smeared them over with gypsum, and let them fly again. But when
Phalanthus saw the crows, he went to his goblet; and when he saw the
fish there, he considered that the place no longer belonged to him and
his party, and so he sent a herald to Iphiclus, demanding permission to
retire, with all his troops, under the protection of a treaty. And when
Iphiclus agreed to this, Phalanthus devised the following
contrivance. Having slain some victims, and taken out the entrails, he
endeavoured to put in some silver and gold, and so to carry it away.
But when Iphiclus perceived this, he prevented it. And when Phalanthus
alleged against him the oath which he had taken, when he swore to allow
them to take away whatever they had in their bellies, he met them with
a counter device, giving them vessels to go away in, but taking away
the rudders, and the oars, and the sails, saying that he had sworn to
give them boats, and nothing further. And as the Phoenicians were in
great perplexity, they buried a great deal of their riches underground,
marking the places where they buried it, that at some future time
they might come and take it up again; but they left a great deal for
Iphiclus. And so, when the Phoenicians had left the place in this
manner, the Greeks became masters of it." And Polyzelus has given the
same account, in his History of Rhodian Affairs; and says&mdash;"That the
only people who knew the secret about the fishes and the crows were
Phaces and his daughter Dorcia; and she, being beloved by Iphiclus, and
having come to an agreement to marry him through the intervention of
her nurse, persuaded the man who brought the water to bring the fish
and put them into the goblet; and she herself whitewashed the crows,
and let them go."</p>

<p>62. And Creophylus, in his Annals of the Ephesians, says&mdash;"Those who
colonized Ephesus, being much perplexed for want of a place where they
could settle, sent at last to the oracle, and asked where they should
build themselves a city; and he told them to build a city in that place
which a fish should show them, and to which a wild boar should guide
them. Accordingly, it is said that some fishermen were breakfasting
at the spot where the fountain called Hypel&aelig;us now is, and where the
harbour is which is called the sacred harbour; and that one of the
fish leaped up with a burning cinder sticking to him, and fell on some
of the refuse; and that by this means a thicket was set on fire, in
which there happened to be a wild boar; and he, being disturbed by
the fire, ran for some distance up the mountain which is called the
Rough Mountain, and at last was transfixed by javelins, and fell where
the temple of Minerva now stands. And the Ephesians, having crossed
over from the island, occupied that for twenty-one years, and in the
twenty-second year they founded Trachea and the towns around Coressus,
and erected a temple

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 570]</span>

to Diana in the market-place, and one to the
Pythian Apollo overlooking the harbour."</p>

<p>63. Now after this long conversation, all of a sudden there was heard
all over the city the music of flutes and the noise of cymbals, and
also a great crash of drums, with singing at the same time. And it
happened to be the time of a festival which used formerly to be called
the Parilia, but which is now called the Romana, in honour of the
temple built to the Fortune of the City, by that most excellent and
accomplished sovereign Hadrian. And all the inhabitants of Rome (and
all the foreigners sojourning in the city) every year keep that day as
a remarkable one. Accordingly, Ulpian said,&mdash;My friends, what is this?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Is it a supper or a marriage feast?<br />
For certainly there is no picnic held now.
</div>

<p>And when some one replied that every one in the city was dancing (using
the verb <ins title="Greek: ballizô">βαλλίζω</ins>) in honour of the goddess,&mdash;My fine fellow,
said Ulpian, laughing, what Greek in the world ever called this dancing
<ins title="Greek: ballismos">βαλλισμός̣</ins> You should have said <ins title="Greek: ballismos">κωμάζουσιν</ins> or <ins title="Greek: choreuousin">χορεύουσιν</ins>,
or, at all events, some word in common use; but you have
bought us a name out of the Subura,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And spoilt the wine by pouring in this water.'
</div>

<p>And Myrtilus said&mdash;But I will prove to you, my dear
Epitim&aelig;us,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
that the word is a genuine Greek word; for you, who want to stop every
one's mouth, have not succeeded in convicting any one of ignorance,
but have proved yourself to be emptier than a snake's cast-off skin.
Epicharmus, my most excellent gentlemen, in his Theori, speaks of the
<ins title="Greek: ballismos">βαλλισμὸς</ins>, and Italy is no great way from Sicily. Accordingly,
in that play, the public ambassadors, surveying the offerings at Pytho,
and mentioning each one separately, speak as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Here there are brazen caldrons, brazen goblets,<br />
And spits. And then to see the men with spits<br />
And flutes, too, dancing (<ins title="Greek: ballizontes">βαλλίζοντες</ins>),
what a sight it was!
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his play which is entitled Nymphoponus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then he did take it, and proceeded onwards;<br />
The rest did follow dancing (<ins title="Greek: eballizon">ἐβάλλιζον</ins>).
</div>

<p>And again he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Dancing (<ins title="Greek: ballizontes">βαλλίζοντες</ins>) they filled the entrance room with dung.<br />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 571]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">NAMES OF FEASTS.</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Curis, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now I see a multitude of men<br />
Hastening to a feast, as if a goodly company<br />

For I should never bear my robe off safely,<br />
Unless my wings had grown.
</div>

<p>I know, too, that the word is found in other places, and when I
recollect the exact passage, I will bring it forward.</p>

<p>64. But we have a right to ask of you, who have quoted to us these
lines out of Homer,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But say, you joyful troop so gaily drest,<br />
Is this a bridal or a friendly feast?&mdash;
</div>

<p>in what respect the different sorts of feasts, which he calls <ins title="Greek: eilapinê">εἰλαπίνη</ins> and <ins title="Greek: eranos">ἔρανος</ins>,
differ from one another? But, since you
are silent, I will tell you; for, as the poet of Syracuse says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I by myself am equal to the task<br />
Which formerly it took two men to answer.
</div>

<p>The ancients used to call sacrifices, and the more splendid kind of preparations, <ins title="Greek: eilapinai">εἰλάπιναι</ins>;
and those who partook of them they used to call <ins title="Greek: eilapinastai">εἰλαπινασταί</ins>. But those feasts they called <ins title="Greek: eranoi">ἔρανοι</ins>,
the materials for which were contributed by all who joined in them; and this name was derived
from all the guests being friendly together (<ins title="Greek: apo tou syneran">ἀπὸ τοῦ συνερᾷν</ins>) and contributing. And this same
<ins title="Greek: eranos">ἔρανος</ins> is also called <ins title="Greek: thiasos">θίασος</ins>, and those who partake of it are called <ins title="Greek: eranistai">ἐρανισταὶ</ins> and <ins title="Greek: synthiasôtai">συνθιαῶται</ins>. The crowd,
also, which follows Bacchus in his festivals is called <ins title="Greek: thiasos">θίασος</ins>, as Euripides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I see three thiasi of women coming.
</div>

<p>And they gave them the name <ins title="Greek: thiasos">θίασος</ins> from the word <ins title="Greek: Theos">θεός</ins>;— and, indeed, the
Lacedæmonian form of the word <ins title="Greek: Theos">θεὸς</ins> is <ins title="Greek: sios">σιός</ins>. And the word <ins title="Greek: eilapinê">εἰλαπίνη</ins> is derived
from the preparation and expense gone to for such purposes; for being
destructive and extravagant is called <ins title="Greek: laphyttein kai lapazein">λαφύττειν καὶ λαπάζειν</ins>, from which words
the poets have used the word <ins title="Greek: alapazô">ἀλαπάζω</ins> for to destroy, And the plunder which
is carried off after the sacking of a city they call <ins title="Greek: laphyra">λάφυρα</ins>. And accordingly
&AElig;schylus and Eripides have given to the more luxurious banquets the name
of <ins title="Greek: eilapinai">εἰλάπιναι</ins>, from the verb <ins title="Greek: lapazô">λαπάζω</ins>. There is also a verb, <ins title="Greek: laptô">λάπτω</ins>, which means to
digest one's food, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 572]</span>

to become relaxed (<ins title="Greek: lagaros">λαγαρὸς</ins>) by becoming empty. And from this word <ins title="Greek: lagaros">λαγαρὸς</ins>
we get the word <ins title="Greek: lagôn">λαγὼν</ins> (the flank), and also <ins title="Greek: laganon">λάγανον</ins> (a thin, broad cake);
and from the word <ins title="Greek: lapattô">λαπάττω</ins> we get <ins title="Greek: lapara">λαπάρα</ins> (the loins). And the verb <ins title="Greek: laphyttô">λαφύττω</ins> means,
with great freedom and abundance to evacuate and erupt oneself. And the
word <ins title="Greek: dapanaô">δαπανάω</ins> (to spend) is derived from <ins title="Greek: daptô">δάπτω</ins>; and <ins title="Greek: daptô">δάπτω</ins> is akin to <ins title="Greek: dapsilês">δαψιλής</ins>; on
which account we find the verbs <ins title="Greek: daptô">δάπτω</ins> and <ins title="Greek: dardaptô">δαρδάπτω</ins> applied to those who eat
in a voracious and savage manner. Homer says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Him the fierce dogs and hungry vultures tore (<ins title="Greek: katedapsan">κατέδαψαν</ins>).
</div>

<p>But the word <ins title="Greek: euôchia">εὐωχία</ins> (a luxurious feast) is derived not from <ins title="Greek: ochê">ὀχὴ</ins>, which
means nutriment, but from everything going on well (<ins title="Greek: apo tou eu echein">ἀπὸ τοῦ εὖ ἔχειν</ins>)
in such a banquet, in which those who assemble honour the deity,
and give themselves up to mirth and relaxation; and from this
relaxation (<ins title="Greek: apo tou eu echein">ἀπὸ τοῦ μεθιέναι</ins>) they call wine <ins title="Greek: methy">μέθυ</ins>, and the god who gave
them wine they call Methymnaeus, and Lyæus, and Evius, and Icius; just
as also they call a man who is not sullen-looking and morose <ins title="Greek: hilaros">ἱλαρός</ins>; on
which account, too, they pray the deity to be propitious (<ins title="Greek: hileôs">ἵλεως</ins>),
uttering the ejaculation <ins title="Greek: iê, iê">ἰὴ, ἰή</ins>. And from this again they call the place
where they do this <ins title="Greek: hieron">ἱερόν</ins>. And that they meant very nearly the same thing
by <ins title="Greek: hileôs">ἵλεως</ins> and <ins title="Greek: hilaros">ἱλαρός</ins> is plain from the language used by Ephippus, in his
play entitled Traffic; for he is speaking of a courtesan, and he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then too, when any one is out of humour,<br />
When he comes in she flatters him discreetly,<br />
And kisses him, not pressing his mouth hard<br />
Like some fierce enemy; but just billing towards him<br />
Like some fond sparrow; then she sings and comforts him,<br />
And makes him cheerful (<ins title="Greek: hilaros">ἱλαρὸς</ins>) and dispels all clouds<br />
From off his face, and renders him propitious (<ins title="Greek: hileôs">ἵλεως</ins>).

<p>65. But the ancients, who represented the gods under the form of men,
arranged all their festivals on a similar principle; for, seeing that
it is not possible to divert men from an eagerness for pleasure, but
that it is useful and expedient to accustom them to enjoy themselves
with moderation and in an orderly manner, they set apart certain times,
and, sacrificing first to the gods, they in this way permitted them
relaxation and enjoyment, in order that every one, thinking that the
gods had come among them, and were present at the
first-fruits and libations, might enjoy himself with order and decency.
Accordingly Homer says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 573]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FEASTS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
There, too, was Pallas to partake the feast:
</div>

<p>and Neptune, too, is represented thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The monarch of the main, a heavenly guest,<br />
In Ethiopia graced the genial feast,<br />
There on the world's extremest verge, revered<br />
With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferr'd,<br />
Distant he lay:<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;
</div>

<p>and of Jupiter he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sire of gods and all the ethereal train<br />
On the warm limits of the furthest main<br />
Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace<br />
The feast of Ethiopia's blameless race.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
</div>

<p>And if a man of more mature age, and devoted to wise and virtuous
pursuits, is present, they are ashamed to say or do anything
indecorous; as also Epicharmus says, somewhere or other:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when their aged superiors are present,<br />
Young men should silent be.
</div>

<p>Therefore, considering that the gods were near to them, they celebrated
their festivals in an orderly and temperate manner; on which account
it was not the fashion of the ancients to lie at their meals, but, as
Homer says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Feasting they sate;
</div>

<p>nor were they accustomed to drink to the extent of drunkenness&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when they'd eaten thus, and drank their fill,<br />
Each to his room retired, not dreaming ill.
</div>

<p>66. But the men of modern times, pretending to be sacrificing to the
gods, and inviting their friends and nearest kinsmen to the sacrifice,
vent imprecations on their children, and abuse their wives, and treat
their slaves with indignity, and threaten the multitude, almost
verifying the line of Homer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But now with speed let's take a short repast,<br />
And well refresh'd to bloody conflict haste.
</div>

<p>Nor do they ever give a thought to what has been said by the poet
who wrote the poem entitled Chiron, whether it is Pherecrates, or
Nicomachus, the teacher of rhythm, or whatever else his name may have
been:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 574]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
When you have ask'd a friend to come to supper,<br />
Do not be angry when you see him come;<br />
That is the part of an unworthy man;<br />
But give yourself to happy thoughts of joy,<br />
And study to amuse your friend and guest.
</div>

<p>But now men utterly forget all these rules, and they recollect only
the lines which follow them, which are all written in imitation of the
Great Eo&aelig; which are attributed to Hesiod, and which are also meant as a
parody on his great work, Works and Days:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When any of us does celebrate<br />
A sacrifice, and bids his friends to th' feast,<br />
Still, if he come, we're vex'd and look askance,<br />
And wish him to depart without delay.<br />
And he his want of welcome soon perceives<br />
And reassumes his shoes; when some one rises<br />
Of the surrounding revellers, and says,<br />
"Here, my friend, do not go; why won't you drink?<br />
Take off your shoes." And then the host again<br />
Is angry with the guest who calls him back,<br />
And quotes some scraps of poetry against him,&mdash;<br />
"Remember, always speed the parting guest,<br />
And when a man is sleeping let him rest."<br />
Do not we in this manner oft behave<br />
When feasting those we choose to call our friends?
</div>

<p>And, moreover, we add this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let not a numerous party vex your mind,<br />
For more are pleased, and the cost's near the same.
</div>

<p>67. And when we are sacrificing to the gods, we spend as little as
possible upon our sacrifices, and give them the most ordinary presents;
as the admirable Menander tells us, in his Drunkenness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We don't do other things as we perform<br />
Our duties to the gods. We sacrifice<br />
One sheep scarce worth ten or a dozen drachm&aelig;;<br />
But for our flute-women, our perfumes rich,<br />
Our harpers, Thasian and Mend&aelig;an wine,<br />
Eels, cheese, and honey to regale ourselves,<br />
We do not a whole talent think too much.<br />
'Tis very well to spend a dozen drachm&aelig;<br />
When we are sacrificing to the gods,<br />
But if you much curtail that slight expense,<br />
Are you not thus dishonouring the gods?<br />
I, if I were a god, would ne'er allow<br />
A scanty loin of beef to load my altars,<br />
Unless an eel were also sacrificed,<br />
So that Callimedon might die of rage.

<div class="sidenote-left">THE DOLE-BASKET.</div>

<p>68. And the ancients call some feasts <ins title="Greek: epidosima">ἐπιδόσιμα</ins>, that is to
say, given into the bargain,&mdash;the same which the Alexandrians call
<ins title="Greek: ex epidomatôn">ἐξ ἐπιδομάτων</ins>. Alexis, at all events, in his Woman at the
Well, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> And now the master here has sent a slave</span><br />
To bring to me a jar of his own wine.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> I understand; this is <ins title="Greek: epidosimos">ἐπιδόσιμος</ins>,</span><br />
A gift into the bargain, as a makeweight;<br />
I praise the wise old woman.
</div>

<p>And Crobylus, in his Supposititious Son, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Laches, I come to you; proceed.</span><br />
<span class="linespace12_25"><i>B.</i> Which way?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> How can you ask? Why, to my mistress, who</span><br />
Has a feast <ins title="Greek: epidosimos">ἐπιδόσιμος</ins> prepared;<br />
And in her honour only yesterday<br />
You made the guests drink down twelve glasses each.
</div>

<p>The ancients, also, were acquainted with the banquets which are now
called dole-basket banquets; and Pherecrates mentions them in his
Forgetful Man, or the Sea, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Having prepared a small dole-basket supper<br />
He went away to Ophela.
</div>

<p>And this clearly points to the dole-basket supper, when a man prepares
a supper for himself, and then puts it in a basket, and goes off to sup
with some one. And Lysias has used the word <ins title="Greek: syndeipnon">σύνδειπνον</ins> for a
banquet, in his speech against Micinus, on his trial for murder; for
he says that he had been invited to a <ins title="Greek: syndeipnon">σύνδειπνον</ins>: and Plato
says&mdash;"Those who had made a <ins title="Greek: syndeipnon">σύνδειπνον</ins>:" and Aristophanes, in
his Gerytades, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Praising great &AElig;schylus in his <ins title="Greek: syndeipna">σύνδειπνα</ins>,
</div>

<p>on which account some people wish to write the title of Sophocles's
play in the neuter gender, <ins title="Greek: Syndeipnon">σύνδειπνον</ins>. Some people also use the
expression <ins title="Greek: synagôgima deipna">συναγώγιμα δεῖπνα</ins>, picnic feasts; as Alexis does, in his Man
fond of Beauty, or the Nymphs, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come, sit you down, and call those damsels in;<br />
We've got a picnic here, but well I know<br />
That your's is but a skin-flint disposition.
</div>

<p>And Ephippus says, in his Geryones,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They also celebrate a picnic feast.
</div>

<p>They also use the verb <ins title="Greek: synagô">συνάγω</ins> for to drink with on another, and the noun <ins title="Greek: synagôgion">συναγώγιον</ins>
for a drinking party. Menander, in his Angry Woman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And for this reason now they drink (<ins title="Greek: synagousi">συνάγουσι</ins>) alone:
</div>

<p>and presently afterwards he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And so they ended the entertainment (<ins title="Greek: synagôgion">συναγώγιον</ins>).
</div>

<p>And probably the <ins title="Greek: synagôgion">συναγώγιον</ins> is the same as that which was also
called <ins title="Greek: to apo symbolôn deipnon">τὸ ἀπὸ συμβολων δεῖπνον</ins>. But what the <ins title="Greek: symbolai">συμβολαὶ</ins>, or contributions,
are, we learn from Alexis, in his Woman who has taken Mandragora,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I'll come and bring my contributions now.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> How, contributions?</span><br />
<span class="linespace7_75"><i>A.</i> The Chalcidians</span><br />
Call fringes, alabaster, scent boxes,<br />
And other things of that kind, contributions.
</div>

<p>But the Argives, as Hegesander tells us in his Commentaries, (the
following are his exact words)&mdash;"The Argives call the contributions
towards an entertainment which are brought by the revellers, <ins title="Greek: chôn">χῶν</ins>; and
each man's share they call <ins title="Greek: aisa">αἶσα</ins>.”</p>

<p>69. And now, since this book also has come to a not unsuitable end,
my good friend Timocrates, let us stop our discussion at this point,
lest any one should think that we were formerly fishes ourselves, as
Empedocles says that he was; for that great natural philosopher says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For I myself have been a boy, a girl,<br />
A bush, a bird, and fish which roams the sea.

<p>both to you and me, O Timocrates. For when some hams were brought
round, and some one asked whether they were tender, using the word <ins title="Greek: takeros">τακερὸς</ins>,&mdash;
In what author does <ins title="Greek: takeros">τακερὸς</ins> occur? said Ulpian: and is there any authority,
too, for calling mustard <ins title="Greek: sinapi">σίναπι</ins> instead of <ins title="Greek: napu">νᾶπυ̣</ins> For I see that that condiment
is being brought round in the dishes with the hams. And I see that the word
<ins title="Greek: kôleos">κωλεὸς</ins>, a ham, <i>a ham</i>, is now used in the masculine gender, and
not in the feminine only, as our Attic writers use it. At all events,
Epicharmus, in his Megarian Woman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Sausages, cheese, and hams <ins title="Greek: kôleoi">χορδὴ</ins>, and artichokes,
But not a single thing that's eatable:
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE WORDS <ins title="Greek: TAKEROS">ΤΑΚΕΡΟΣ</ins> AND <ins title="Greek: SINAPI">ΣΙΝΑΠΙ</ins>.</div>

<p>and in his Cyclops he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pig's tripe is good, by Jove, and so is ham (<ins title="Greek: kôleos">κωλεός</ins>).
</div>

<p>And learn this now from me, O you wise man, that Epicharmus, uses <ins title="Greek: chordê">χορδὴ</ins> for
what, in every other place, he calls <ins title="Greek: orya">ὀρύα</ins>, tripe. And I see, too, that salt is used in
seasoning in other dishes; but of salt which is not seasoned the Cynics
are full, among whom we find, in the Corycus of Antiphanes, another
Cynic saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>I see, too, that brine is mingled with vinegar; and I know, too, that
now some of the inhabitants of Pontus prepare the pickle which they
call oxygarum, or vinegar pickle, by itself.</p>

<p>2. Zoilus replied to this, and said&mdash;Aristophanes, my good friend, in
his Lemnian Woman, has used the word <ins title="Greek: takeros">τακερὸς</ins> for delicate, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Lemnus producing good and delicate (<ins title="Greek: takerous">τακεροὺς</ins>) beans:

<p>and Pherecrates, in his Crapatalli, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To make the vetches delicate (<ins title="Greek: takerous">τακερούς</ins>):
</div>

<p>and Nicander the Colophonian has used the word <ins title="Greek: sinapi">σιόνηπυ</ins> in his
Theriacans, where he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A brazen cucumber and mustard too (<ins title="Greek: sinêpyos">σίνηπυ</ins>);

<p>And Crates, in his treatise on the Attic Dialect, introduces
Aristophanes as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He looked mustard (<ins title="Greek: sinapy">σίναπυ</ins>) and drew down his brows,

<p>as Seleucus quotes it, in his books on Hellenism. But it is a line out

<p>for no Attic writer ever used the form <ins title="Greek: sinapy">σίναπυ</ins>, although there is
a reason for each form. For <ins title="Greek: napy">νάπυ</ins> may be said, as if it were <ins title="Greek: naphy">νάφυ</ins>,
because it has no <ins title="Greek: physis">φύσις</ins>, or growth. For it is <ins title="Greek: aphyes">ἀφυὲς</ins> and little, like the
anchovy, which is called <ins title="Greek: aphyê">ἀφύη</ins>, and is called <ins title="Greek: sinapy">σίναπυ</ins>, because it injures
the eyes (<ins title="Greek: sinetai tous ôpas">σίνεται τοὺς ὦπας</ins>) by its smell, as the onion has

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 578]</span>

the name of <ins title="Greek: krommyon">κρόμμυον</ins>, because it makes us wink our eyes (<ins title="Greek: hoti tas koras myomen">ὅτι τὰς κόρας

<div class="blockindent">
This evil is no longer evil; so<br />
My daughter is corrupted by the stranger.

<p>3. We then, my good friend, have gone along with you in these
inquiries. But we have a right to expect an answer from you, in what
author the word <ins title="Greek: paropsis">παροψὶς</ins> is used for a vessel. For when
speaking of some victuals of various sorts, which were carefully
dressed, and of some other things of this sort, I am aware that Plato,
in his Festivals, has used the following expressions&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Whence barley-cakes might be got, and <ins title="Greek: paropsides">παροψίδες</ins>.
</div>

<p>And again, in his Europa, speaking at considerable length of some
exquisite dish, he has used the following expressions among others&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> The woman is asleep;</span><br />
<span class="linespace8"><i>B.</i> I am aware</span><br />
That she is doing nothing.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> The <ins title="Greek: paropsides">παροψίδες</ins></span><br />
Are all awake; and there is not a thing<br />
More calculated to give pleasure always.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> But where are these <ins title="Greek: paropsides">παροψίδες</ins>, I pray you?</span>
</div>

<p>And in the passage immediately following, he uses the word <ins title="Greek: paropsis">παροψὶς</ins>, as
if it were equivalent to <ins title="Greek: paropsônêma">παροψώνημα</ins>, a delicacy; and in his Phaon he
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Other men's things are like <ins title="Greek: paropsides">παροψίδες</ins>,<br />
They please a short time, and are quickly spent.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his D&aelig;dalus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
All women have one set of principles,<br />
And have a lover, like a <ins title="Greek: paropsis">παροψὶς</ins>, ready.

<p>4. So when Ulpian made no reply,&mdash;But I, said Leonidas, have a right to
speak, since I have been silent a long time. But as Evenus the Parian
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>5. And my excellent friend Myrtilus,&mdash;for I have taken the words out of
your mouth, Antiphanes,&mdash;in his B&oelig;otian, has used this word <ins title="Greek: paropsis">παροψὶς</ins>

<p>But the word is used in an ambiguous sense by Xenophon, in the first
book of his Cyrop&aelig;dia. For the philosopher says, "They brought him
<ins title="Greek: paropsidas">παροψίδας</ins>, and condiments of all sorts, and food of all
kinds." And in the works of the author of Chiron, which is usually
attributed to Pherecrates, the word <ins title="Greek: paropsis">παροψὶς</ins> is used for
seasoning; and not, as Didymus, in his treatise on Words used in a
Corrupted Sense, asserts, for a vessel. For he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>6. When speaking of hams, they use the two forms <ins title="Greek: kôlê">κωλῆ</ins> and
<ins title="Greek: kôlên">κωλήν</ins>. Eupolis, in his Autolycus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<ins title="Greek: sykea">συκέα</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: leontê">λεοντῆ</ins> from <ins title="Greek: leontea">λεοντέα</ins>; so

<div class="sidenote-left">TURNIPS.</div>

<p>7. And as immediately after this a great quantity of food of all sorts
was brought in, we will just mention those dishes which seem most
worthy of being remembered; for there was a great quantity of birds,
and of geese, and also of young birds (which some people call <ins title="Greek: pipoi">πίποι</ins>),
and of pigs, and of those highly-esteemed birds the pheasants.
And after I have told you about the vegetables, I will then enumerate
to you the other dishes also.</p>

<p>8. First of all, there were turnips; and Apellas, in his treatise
on the Cities in Peloponnesus, says that turnips are called <ins title="Greek: gasteres">γαστέρες</ins>
by the Laced&aelig;monians: and Nicander the Colophonian, in his
Dialects, says that among the B&oelig;otians it is cabbages which are called
<ins title="Greek: gasteres">γαστέρες</ins>, and that turnips are called in
Boeotia <ins title="Greek: zekeltides">ζεκελτίδες</ins>.
But Amerias and Timachidas affirm that it is gourds which
are called <ins title="Greek: zakeltides">ζακελτίδες</ins>.
And Speusippus, in the second book of
his treatise on Things resembling one another, says&mdash;"The radish, the
turnip, the rape, and the nasturtium all resemble each other." But
Glaucus, in his Cookery Book, spells the word <ins title="Greek: rhaphys">ῥάφυς</ins> (rape)
with the lene <ins title="Greek: p">π</ins>,&mdash;<ins title="Greek: rhapys">ῥάπυς</ins>. But these vegetables have
nothing else like them, unless, indeed, it be the plant which we call
bounias: but Theophrastus does not use the name of bounias, but calls
it a sort of male turnip; and perhaps the plant which he means is the
bounias. And Nicander, in his Georgics, mentions the bounias&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Sow turnips on a well-roll'd field, that they<br />
May grow as large as the flat dish that holds them.<br />

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*<br />

. . . . . For there are two kinds<br />
Which from the radish spring: one long, one firm,<br />
Both seen in well-till'd beds in kitchen gardens.
</div>

<p>And the turnips which grow on the banks of the Cephisus are mentioned
by Cratis, in his Orators, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And wholly like the turnips of Cephisus.
</div>

<p>But Theophrastus says that there are two kinds of turnips, the male and
the female, and that they both come from the same seed; but Posidonius
the Stoic philosopher, in the twenty-seventh book of his Histories,
concerning Dalmatia, says that there are some turnips which grow
without any cultivation, and also some carrots that grow wild. But
Diphilus the physician, of Siphnos, says&mdash;"The turnip has attenuating
properties, and is harsh and indigestible, and moreover is apt to cause
flatulence: but the vegetable called bounias is superior to that; for
it is sweeter in taste and more digestible, in addition to being

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 582]</span>

wholesome for the stomach and nutritious. But the turnip," he says,
"when roasted, is more easily digested, but in this state it attenuates
the blood still more." This vegetable is mentioned by Eubulus, in his
Ancylion, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I bring this turnip to be roasted now.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Enthusiast, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I speak to Ptolemy, roasting slices of turnip.
</div>

<p>But the turnip, when pickled, is more attenuating in its effects than
when boiled, especially when it is pickled with mustard, as Diphilus
says.</p>

<p>9. Then there was the cabbage. Eudemus the Athenian, in his treatise
on Vegetables, says that there are three kinds of cabbage&mdash;the kind
called the salt-cabbage, and the smooth-leaved-cabbage, and the
parsley-cabbage: and that the salt-cabbage is reckoned the finest of
all in respect of its delicacy of taste; and it grows in Eretria, and
Cyme, and Rhodes, and also in Cnidos and Ephesus: but the smooth-leaved
kind is found in every country; and the parsley-cabbage has its name
from the curly nature of its leaves, for it is like parsley, both in
that respect and in its general thickness. But Theophrastus writes
thus&mdash;"But of the <ins title="Greek: rhaphanos">ῥάφανος</ins>,&mdash;I mean the cabbage,&mdash;there is
one kind with curly leaves, and another with smooth leaves, and a third
which is wild." And Diphilus the Siphnian says&mdash;"The finest and most
delicious cabbage grows in Cyme: in Alexandria it is bitter; and the
seed which is brought from Rhodes to Alexandria produces sweet cabbage
for one year, after which time it degenerates again, from the nature of
the soil." And Nicander, in his Georgics, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The smooth-leaved cabbage sometimes wild is found,<br />
And then the curly many-leaved plants<br />
Are often sown in beds; . . . . . . . .<br />
There is another kind, of reddish colour,<br />
Like frogs in drought; some of bad colour too<br />
Do come from Cyme, like the dingy soles<br />
Which cobblers often sew on worn-out boots;<br />
And these the ancients do the Prophets call.
</div>

<p>But perhaps Nicander calls the cabbage Prophet, as being sacred; since
in Hipponax, in his Iambics, we find some such lines as these,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He falling down worshipp'd the seven-leaved cabbage,<br />
To which, before she drank the poison'd draught,<br />
Pandora brought a cake at the Thargelia.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 583]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CABBAGE.</div>

<p>And Ananius says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And, by the cabbage do I swear, I love thee<br />
By far the most of mortal men . . . .
</div>

<p>And Teleclides, in his Prytanes, uses the oath, "Yes, by the cabbages!"
and Epicharmus has the same exclamation in his Earth and Sea; and so
has Eupolis, in his Dyers; and it appears to have been an Ionian oath:
and there is nothing very strange in the fact of some people having
sworn by the cabbage, since Zeno the Citti&aelig;an, the founder of the sect
of the Stoics, imitating the oath of Socrates, "by the bitch," was used
himself to swear "by the caper," as Empodus relates in his Memorabilia.</p>

<p>10. And at Athens the cabbage used to be given to women who had just
been delivered, as a sort of medicine, having a tendency to add to
their nourishment. Accordingly, Ephippus, in his Geryones, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace6">What shall next be done?</span><br />
There is no garland now before the doors,<br />
No savoury smell strikes on my nostril's edge<br />
From Amphidromian festival, in which<br />
The custom is to roast large bits of cheese,<br />
Such as the Chersonesus furnishes,<br />
And then to boil a radish bright with oil,<br />
And fry the breasts of well-fed household lamb,<br />
And to pluck pigeons, thrushes too, and finches,<br />
And to eat squids and cuttle-fish together,<br />
And many polypi with wondrous curls,<br />
And to quaff many goblets of pure wine.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Parasite, speaks of the cabbage as an economical
food, in the following lines, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And what these things are, you, my wife, know well;<br />
Garlic, and cheese, and cheesecakes, dainty dishes<br />
Fit for a gentleman; no fish cured and salted,<br />
No joints of lamb well stuff'd with seasoning,<br />
No forced meat of all kinds of ingredients;<br />
No high made dishes, fit to kill a man;<br />
But they will boil some cabbage sweet, ye gods!<br />
And in the dish with it some pulse of pease.
</div>

<p>And Diphilus says, in his Insatiable Man,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
All sorts of dainties now come round us here,<br />
All of their own accord. There's cabbage fresh,<br />
Well boil'd in oil; and many paunches, and<br />
Dishes of tender meat. No . . . . by Jove,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 584]</span>

Nor are they like my platters of bruised olives.
</div>

<p>And Alc&aelig;eus, in his Pal&aelig;stra, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now she's roasted a large dish of cabbage.
</div>

<p>And Polyzelus, in his Birth of the Muses, names cabbages; and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The close-grown cabbage with its lofty leaves.
</div>

<p>11. The next thing to be mentioned is beet-root. Of beet-root
(according to the opinion of Theophrastus), the white is more juicy
than the black, and it contains less seed, and it is the kind which
is called the Sicilian beet. But, says he, the beet called <ins title="Greek: seutlis">σευτλὶς</ins>
is a different kind from the <ins title="Greek: teutlon">τεῦτλον</ins>. On which
account, Diphilus the comic poet, in his drama called the Hero,
reproaches some one for speaking incorrectly, and for calling
<ins title="Greek: teutla">τεῦτλα</ins>, <ins title="Greek: teutlidas">τευτλίδας</ins>.
And Eudemus, in his treatise on
Vegetables, says that there are four kinds of <ins title="Greek: teutla">τεὖτλα</ins>: there is
the kind which may be pulled, the kind with a stalk, the white kind,
and the common kind; and this last is of a brown colour. But Diphilus
the Siphnian says that the beet which he calls <ins title="Greek: seutlion">σεύτλιον</ins> is
more juicy than the cabbage, and is also, in a moderate degree, more
nutritious; and it ought to be boiled and eaten with mustard, and that
then it has a tendency to attenuate the blood, and to destroy worms;
but the white kind is better for the stomach, while the black is more
diuretic. He says, also, that their roots are more pleasing to the
palate, and more nutritious.</p>

<p>12. Then there is the carrot. "This vegetable," says Diphilus, "is
harsh, but tolerably nutritious, and moderately good for the stomach;
but it passes quickly through the bowels, and causes flatulence: it is
indigestible, diuretic, and not without some influence in prompting men
to amatory feelings; on which account it is called a philtre by some
people." And Numenius, in his Man fond of Fishing, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Of all the plants which grow in fields unsown,<br />
Or which take root in fertile plough'd-up lands<br />
In winter, or when flowering spring arrives,<br />
Such as the thistle dry, or the wild carrot,<br />
Or the firm rape, or lastly, the wild cabbage.
</div>

<p>And Nicander, in the second book of his Georgics, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then there is also the deep root of fennel,<br />
And of rock-parsley, and the carrot too,<br />
Which loves dry soils, the sow-thistle, the myrrh plant,<br />
The dog-tongue and the chicory. And with them bruise<br />
The tough hard-tasted leaves of arum, and<br />
The plant which farmers do entitle bird's-milk.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 585]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LEEKS.</div>

<p>Theophrastus also mentions the carrot; and Ph&aelig;nias, in the fifth book
of his treatise on Plants, speaks as follows:&mdash;"But as to the nature of
the seed, the plant which is called <ins title="Greek: sêps">σὴψ</ins> and the seed of the
carrot are much alike." And in his first book he says&mdash;"The following
plants have seed in pods of umbellated form: the anise, fennel, the
carrot, the bur-parsley, hemlock, coriander, and aconite (which some
call mousekiller)." But, since Nicander has mentioned the arum, I must
also add that Ph&aelig;nias, in the book which I have just mentioned, writes
thus:&mdash;"The dracontium, which some call arum or aronia." But Diocles,
in the first book of his treatise on the Wholesomes, calls the carrot,
not <ins title="Greek: staphylinos">σταφυλῖνος</ins>, but <ins title="Greek: astaphylinos">ἀσταφύλινος</ins>. There is also
another kind which is called <ins title="Greek: karôton">καρωτὸν</ins>, which is a large and
well-grown carrot, more juicy than the <ins title="Greek: staphylinos">σταφυλῖνος</ins>,
and more heating,&mdash;more diuretic, very good for the stomach, and very easily
digested, as Diphilus assures us.</p>

<p>13. Then there is the <ins title="Greek: kephalôton">κεφαλωτὸν</ins>, or leek, which the same Diphilus says
is also called <ins title="Greek: prasion">πράσιον</ins>; and he says that it
is superior to the kind called the sliced-leek, and that it has some
effect in attenuating the blood, and is nutritious, and apt to cause
flatulence. But Ep&aelig;netus, in his Cookery Book, says that the leeks are
also called <ins title="Greek: gêthyllides">γηθυλλίδες</ins>; and I find this name occurring in Eubulus, in his
Pornoboscus, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I cannot now eat any other loaf,<br />
For I've just had one at Gnath&aelig;nius',<br />
Whom I found boiling up <ins title="Greek: gêthyllides">γηθυλλίδες</ins>.
</div>

<p>But some say that the <ins title="Greek: gêthyllis">γηθυλλὶς</ins> is the same as the peculiar kind of leek
called <ins title="Greek: gêthyon">γήθυον</ins>, which Phrynichus mentions in his Saturn. And Didymus,
interpreting that play, says that the <ins title="Greek: gêthyon">γήθυον</ins> resembles the leek called
the vine-leek, or <ins title="Greek: ampeloprason">ἀμπελόπρασον</ins>; and he says that they are also called
<ins title="Greek: epithyllides">ἐπιθυλλίδες</ins>. And Epicharmus also mentions the gethyllides in his
Philoctetes, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Two heads of garlic, two gethyllides.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his second &AElig;olosicon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Some roots of leeks (<ins title="Greek: gêthyôn">γηθύων</ins>), which taste almost like garlic.
</div>

<p>And Polemo the geographer, in his book on Samothrace, says that
Latona had a longing for the gethyllis, writing as follows:&mdash;"Among
the Delphians, at the festival which they call the Theoxenia, there

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 586]</span>

is a rule that whoever brings the largest gethyllis to Latona shall
receive a portion of food from off her table; and I myself have seen
a gethyllis as big as a turnip or as the round rape. And men say that
Latona, when she was pregnant with Apollo, longed for the gethyllis; on
which account it is treated with this respect."</p>

<p>14. Next comes the gourd. But as gourds were served round to us in
the winter season, every one marvelled, thinking that they were fresh
gourds; and we recollected what the beautiful Aristophanes said in his
Seasons, praising the glorious Athens in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> There you shall at mid-winter see</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">Cucumbers, gourds, and grapes, and apples,</span><br />
And wreaths of fragrant violets<br />
<span class="linespace1">Cover'd with dust, as if in summer.</span><br />
And the same man will sell you thrushes,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And pears, and honey-comb, and olives,</span><br />
Beestings, and tripe, and summer swallows,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And grasshoppers, and bullock's paunches.</span><br />
There you may see full baskets pack'd<br />
<span class="linespace1">With figs and myrtle, crown'd with snow;</span><br />
There you may see fine pumpkins join'd<br />
<span class="linespace1">To the round rape and mighty turnip;</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> That's a fine thing if all the year</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">A man can have whate'er he pleases.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Say rather, it's the worst of evils;</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">For if the case were different,</span><br />
Men would not cherish foolish fancies<br />
<span class="linespace1">Nor rush into insane expenses.</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">I might myself bear off these things;</span><br />
As indeed in other cities,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Athens excepted, oft I do:</span><br />
However, as I tell you now,<br />
<span class="linespace1">The Athenians have all these things.</span><br />
Because, as we may well believe,<br />
<span class="linespace1">They pay due honour to the gods</span>.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> 'Tis well for them they honour you,</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">Which brings them this enjoyment, since</span><br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 587]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">POULTRY.</div>

<p>At all events, we were astonished eating cucumbers in the month of
January; for they were green, and full of their own peculiar flavour,
and they happened to have been dressed by cooks who above all men
knew how to dress and season such things. Laurentius, therefore, asked
whether the ancients were acquainted with this vegetable, or with
this way of dressing it. And Ulpian said&mdash;Nicander the Colophonian,
in the second book of his Georgics, mentions this way of dressing the
vegetable, calling the gourds not <ins title="Greek: kolokyntai">κολόκυνται</ins>, but <ins title="Greek: sikyai">σίκυαι</ins>; for, indeed, that
was one of their names, as we have said before. And his words are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
First cut the gourds in slices, and then run<br />
Threads through their breadth, and dry them in the air;<br />
Then smoke them hanging them above the fire;<br />
So that the slaves may in the winter season<br />
Take a large dish and fill it with the slices,<br />
And feast on them on holidays: meanwhile<br />
Let the cook add all sorts of vegetables,<br />
And throw them seed and all into the dish;<br />
Let them take strings of gherkins fairly wash'd,<br />
And mushrooms, and all sorts of herbs in bunches,<br />
And curly cabbages, and add them too.
</div>

<p>15. The next thing to be mentioned is poultry. And since poultry was
placed on the gourds and on other scraped (<ins title="Greek: knista">κνιστὰ</ins>) vegetables,
(and this is what Aristophanes in his Delian Woman says of chopped
up vegetables, “<ins title="Greek: knista">κνιστὰ</ins>, or pressed grapes,”) Myrtilus said,—But now,
in our time, we have got into a habit of calling nothing <ins title="Greek: ornithas">ὄρνιθας</ins> or
<ins title="Greek: ornithia">ὀρνίθια</ins> but pullets, of which I see a quantity
now being brought round. (And Chrysippus the philosopher, in the
fifth book of his Treatise on what is Honourable and Pleasant,
writes thus&mdash;"As some people insist upon it that white pullets are
nicer than black ones.") And the names given to the male fowl are
<ins title="Greek: alektryones">ἀλεκτρυόνες</ins> and <ins title="Greek: alektorides">ἀλεκτορίδες</ins>. But anciently, men
were accustomed to use the word <ins title="Greek: ornis">ὄρνις</ins>, both in the masculine
and feminine gender, and to apply it to other birds, and not to this
species in particular to the exclusion of others, as is now done when
we speak of buying birds, and mean only poultry. Accordingly, Homer
says,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And many birds (<ins title="Greek: ornithes polloi">ὄρνιθες πολλοὶ</ins>)
beneath the sun's bright rays.
</div>

<p>And in another place he uses the word in the feminine gender, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A tuneful bird (<ins title="Greek: ornithi ligyrê">ὄρνιθι λιγυρῇ</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 588]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
As the bold bird her helpless young attends,<br />

<div class="blockindent">

He cried out, “drive this poultry (<ins title="Greek: tas ornithas">τὰς ὄρνιθας</ins>) from our doors”

<div class="blockindent">
She scarcely could the poultry (<ins title="Greek: tas orneis">τὰς ὄρνεις</ins>) drive away.

<p>But Cratinus, in his Nemesis, has used the form <ins title="Greek: ornithion">ὀρνίθιον</ins>,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And all the other birds (<ins title="Greek: ornithia">ὀρνίθια</ins>).

<p>And they use not only the form <ins title="Greek: ornin">ὄρνιν</ins>, but also that of <ins title="Greek: ornitha">ὄρνιθα</ins>,
in the masculine gender. The same Cratinus says in the same play&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A scarlet winged bird (<ins title="Greek: ornitha phoinikopteron">ὄρνιθα φοινικόπτερον</ins>).

<div class="blockindent">
You, then, must now become a large bird (<ins title="Greek: ornitha megan">ὄρνιθα μέγαν</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Sophocles, in his Antenorid&aelig;, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A bird (<ins title="Greek: ornitha">ὄρνιθα</ins>), and a crier, and a servant.

I make you not a bird (<ins title="Greek: ornitha">ὄρνιθα</ins>) of this my journey.

Menander, in his Twin Sisters, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>16. But, on the other hand, the ancients sometimes also
used the word <ins title="Greek: alektryôn">ἀλεκτρυὼν</ins> in the feminine gender for a hen.
Cratinus, in his Nemesis, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This is your work, O Leda. Take you care<br />
To imitate the manners of a hen (<ins title="Greek: alektryônos">ἀλεκτρυόνος</ins>)<br />

<p>And Anaxandrides says, in his Tereus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They saw the boars their species propagate<br />
With joy, and likewise all the hens (<ins title="Greek: tas alektryonas">τὰς ἀλεμτρυόνας</ins>).
</div>

<p>And since I have mentioned this comic poet, and as I know, too, that
this play of his, namely Tereus, is not reckoned one of his best, I
will also bring forward, my friends, for your judgment, what Cham&aelig;leon
of Heraclea has said about him in the sixth book of his treatise on
Comedy; where he uses the following language:&mdash;"Anaxandrides once,
publishing a dithyrambic poem at Athens, entered the city on a horse,
and recited some lines of his Ode. And he was a very fine, handsome
man to look at; and he let his hair grow, and wore a purple robe with
golden fringes, but being a man of a bitter disposition he was in the
habit of behaving in some such manner as this with respect to his
comedies. Whenever he did not get the victory he took his play and
sent it to the frankincense market to be torn up to pack bunches of
frankincense in, and did not revise it as most people did. And in this
way he destroyed many clever and elegant plays; being, by reason of his
old age, very sulky with the spectators. And he is said to have been a
Rhodian by birth, of the city of Camirus: and I wonder therefore how it
was that his Tereus got preserved, since it did not obtain the victory;
and I feel the same wonder in the case of others by the same author.
And Theopompus, in his Peace, also uses the word <ins title="Greek: alektryôn">ἀλεκτρύων</ins> for
hens, speaking thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I am so vex'd at having lost the hen (<ins title="Greek: alektryona">ἀλεκτρυόνα</ins>)<br />
Which laid the finest eggs in all the yard.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his D&aelig;dalus, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 590]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
She laid a noble egg, like any hen (<ins title="Greek: alektryôn">ἀλεκτρυών</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Sometimes we find that hens (<ins title="Greek: alektryones">ἀλεκτρυόνες</ins>) when driven about,<br />
And frighten'd, lay wind eggs.
</div>

<p>And in the Clouds, where he is explaining to the old man the difference
between the names, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Tell me then, now, what name I ought to give them.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Call this, the hen, <ins title="Greek: alektryainan">ἀλεκτρύαιναν</ins>, thus,</span><br />
And call her mate, the cock, <ins title="Greek: alektora">ἀλέκτορα</ins>.
</div>

<p>And we find the cock called <ins title="Greek: alektoris">ἀλεκτορὶς</ins> and <ins title="Greek: alektôr">ἀλέκτωρ</ins>. And Simonides writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O tuneful voiced <ins title="Greek: alektôr">ἀλέκτωπ</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Cratinus, in his Seasons, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Like the Persian loud-voiced cock (<ins title="Greek: alektôr">ἀλέκτωρ</ins>),<br />
Who every hour sings his song.
</div>

<p>And he has this name from rousing us from our beds (<ins title="Greek: lektron">λέκτρον</ins>). But the
Dorians, who write <ins title="Greek: lektron">ὄρνις</ins> with a <ins title="Greek: x">ξ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: ornis">ὄρνιξ</ins>, make the genitive with a <ins title="Greek: ch">χ</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: ornichos">ὄρνιχος</ins>. But Alcman writes the nominative with a <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The purple bird (<ins title="Greek: ornis">ὄρνις</ins>) of spring.
</div>

<p>Though I am aware that he too makes the genitive with a <ins title="Greek: ch">χ</ins>,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But yet by all the birds (<ins title="Greek: ornichôn">ὀρνίχων</ins>).
</div>

<p>17. The next thing to be mentioned is the pig, under the name of
<ins title="Greek: delphax">δέλφαξ</ins>. Epicharmus calls the male pig <ins title="Greek: delphax">δέλφαξ</ins>
in his Ulysses the Deserter, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I lost by an unhappy chance<br />
<span class="linespace1">A pig (<ins title="Greek: delphaka">δέλφακα</ins>) belonging to the neighbours,</span><br />
Which I was keeping for Eleusis<br />
<span class="linespace1">And Ceres's mysterious feast.</span><br />
Much was I grieved; and now he says<br />
<span class="linespace1">That I did give it to th' Ach&aelig;ans,</span><br />
Some kind of pledge; and swears that I<br />
<span class="linespace1">Betray'd the pig (<ins title="Greek: ton delphaka">τὸν δέλφακα</ins>) designedly.</span>
</div>

<p>And Anaxilus also, in his Circe, has used the word <ins title="Greek: delphax">δέλφαξ</ins> in
the masculine gender; and moreover has used it of a full-grown pig,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Some of you that dread goddess will transform<br />
To pigs (<ins title="Greek: delphakas">δέλφακας</ins>), who range the mountains and the woods.<br />
Some she will panthers make; some savage wolves,<br />
And terrible lions.
</div>

<p>But Aristophanes, in his Fryers, applies the word to female pigs, and
says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 591]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PIGS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
The paunch, too, of a sow in autumn born (<ins title="Greek: delphakos opôrinês">δέλφακος ὀπωρίνης</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in his Acharnians he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For she is young (<ins title="Greek: nea">νέα</ins>), but when she is a sow (<ins title="Greek: delphakoumena">δελφακουμένα</ins>),<br />
You'll see she'll have a large, fat, ruddy tail;<br />
And if you keep her she'll be a noble pig (<ins title="Greek: choiros kala">χοῖρος καλά</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Eupolis, in his Golden Age, uses it as feminine; and Hipponax
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: Hôs Ephesiê delphax">Ώς Έφεσίη δέλφαξ</ins>.
</div>

<p>And, indeed, it is the female pig which is more correctly called by
this name, as having <ins title="Greek: delphyas">δελφύας</ins>, for that word <ins title="Greek: delphys">δελφὺς</ins>
means a womb. And it is the word from which <ins title="Greek: adelphos">ἀδελφὸς</ins> is
derived. But respecting the age of these animals, Cratinus speaks in
his Archilochi, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
These men have <ins title="Greek: delphakes">δέλφακες</ins>, the others <ins title="Greek: choiroi">χοῖροι</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes the grammarian, in his treatise on Ages, says&mdash;"Those
pigs which are now come to a compact form, are called <ins title="Greek: delphakes">δέλφακες</ins>; but those which
are tender, and are full of juice,
are called <ins title="Greek: choiroi">χοῖροι</ins>;" and this makes that line of Homer
intelligible&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The servants all have little pigs (<ins title="Greek: choirea">χοίρεα</ins>) to eat,<br />

</div>

<p>And Plato the comic poet, in his Poet, uses the word in the masculine
gender, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He led away the pig (<ins title="Greek: ton delphaka">τόν δέλφακα</ins>) in silence.
</div>

<p>But there was ancient custom, as Androtion tells us, for the sake of
the produce of the herds, never to slay a sheep which had not been
shorn, or which had never had young, on which account they always ate
full-grown animals:</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But on fat hogs the dainty suitors feast.
</div>

<p>And even to this day the priest of Minerva never sacrifices a lamb,
and never tastes cheese. And when, on one occasion, there was a want
of oxen, Philochorus says, that a law was passed that they should
abstain from slaying them on account of their scarcity, wishing to get
a greater number, and to increase the stock by not slaying them. But
the Ionians use the word <ins title="Greek: choiros">χοιρος</ins> also of the female pig, as
Hipponax does, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
With pure libations and the offer'd paunch<br />
Of a wild sow (<ins title="Greek: agrias choirou">ἀγρίας χοίρου</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Sophocles, in his T&aelig;narus, a satyric drama, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Should you then guard her, like a chain'd-up sow (<ins title="Greek: choiron desmian">χοῖρον δεσμίαν</ins>)?
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 592]</span></p>

<p>And Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, in the ninth book of his Commentaries,
says&mdash;"When I was at Assus, the Assians brought me a pig (<ins title="Greek: choiron">χοῖρον</ins>)
two cubits and a half in height, and the whole of his body
corresponding in length to that height; and of a colour as white
as snow: and they said that King Eumenes had been very diligent in
buying all such animals of them, and that he had given as much as four
thousand drachm&aelig; a piece for one." And &AElig;schylus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But I will place this carefully fed pig<br />
Within the crackling oven; and, I pray,<br />
What nicer dish can e'er be given to man?
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Is he a white one?</span><br />
<span class="linespace6_5"><i>B.</i> Aye, indeed he is</span><br />
A snow-white pig (<ins title="Greek: choiros">χοῖρος</ins>), and singed most carefully.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Now boil him, and take care he is not burnt.</span>
</div>

<p>And again in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But having kill'd this pig (<ins title="Greek: choiron tonde">χοῖρον τόνδε</ins>), of the same litter<br />
Which has wrought so much mischief in the house,<br />
Pushing and turning ev'rything upside down.
</div>

<p>And these lines have all been quoted by Cham&aelig;leon, in his Commentary on
&AElig;schylus.</p>

<p>18. But concerning the pig, that it is accounted a sacred animal
among the Cretans, Agathocles the Babylonian, in the first book of
his account of Cyzicus, speaks as follows&mdash;"They say that Jupiter was
born in Crete, on the mountain Dicte; on which mountain a mysterious
sacrifice used to take place. For it is said that a sow allowed Jupiter
to suck its udder. And that she going about with her constant grunting,
made the whining of the infant inaudible to those who were looking
for him. On which account all the Cretans think that that animal is
to be worshipped; and nothing, it is said, can induce them to eat
its flesh. And the Praisians also sacrifice to a sow; and this is a
regular sacrifice among that people before marriage. And Neanthes of
Cyzicus gives a similar account, in the second book of his treatise on
Mysteries.</p>

<p>Ach&aelig;us the Eretrian mentions full-grown sows under the name of <ins title="Greek: petalides hyes">πεταλίδες ὕες</ins>
in &AElig;thon, a satyric drama, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And I have often heard of full-grown sows<br />
Under this shape and form.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 593]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PIGS.</div>

<p>But he has given the name of <ins title="Greek: petalides">πεταλίδες</ins> by a metaphor from heifers. For
they are called <ins title="Greek: petêloi">πέτηλοι</ins>, or spreading, from their horns, when they have
spreading horns. And Eratosthenes has spoken of pigs in the same way
as Achæus has in his Anterinnys, and has called them <ins title="Greek: larinoi">λαρινοὶ</ins>, using
this word metaphorically, which properly belongs to fatted oxen which
were called so from the verb <ins title="Greek: larineuomai">λαπινεύομαι</ins>, which is a word of the same
meaning as <ins title="Greek: sitizomai">σιτίζομαι</ins>, to be fed up. And Sophron uses the word&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: boes de larineuontai">βόες δὲ λαρινεύονται</ins>;
</div>

<p>or perhaps it comes from Larina, a small town of Epirus, or from the
name of the herdsman, which may have been Larinus.
</p>

<p>19. And once when a pig was served up before us, the half of which was
being carefully roasted, and the other half boiled gently, as if it had
been steamed, and when all marvelled at the cleverness of the cook, he
being very proud of his skill, said&mdash;And, indeed, there is not one of
you who can point out the place where he received the death wound; or
where his belly was cut so as to be stuffed with all sorts of dainties.
For it has thrushes in it, and other birds; and it has also in it parts
of the abdomens of pigs, and slices of a sow's womb, and the yolks of
eggs, and moreover the entrails of birds, with their ovaries, those
also being full of delicate seasoning, and also pieces of meat shred
into thin shavings and seasoned with pepper. For I am afraid to use the
word <ins title="Greek: isikia">ἰσίκια</ins> before Ulpian, although I know that he himself is
very fond of the thing. And, indeed, my favourite author Paxamus speaks
of it by this name, and I myself do not care much about using no words
but such as are strictly Attic. Do you, therefore, show me now how this
pig was killed, and how I contrived to roast half of him and to boil
the other side.&mdash;And as we kept on examining him, the cook said,&mdash;But
do you think that I know less about my business than the ancient cooks,
of whom the comic poets speak? for Posidippus, in his Dancing Women,
speaks as follows&mdash;and it is a cook who is represented as making the
following speech to his pupils&mdash;</p>

Know that in the cookery no seasoning<br />
Is equal to the sauce of impudence.<br />
And, if I must confess the whole o' the truth,<br />
You'll find this quality of great use everywhere.<br />
See now, this tribune, who displays a breastplate<br />
All over scales, or dragon wrought in steel,<br />

They all crouch down before him: but if you bear<br />
Yourself with honesty and spirit towards him,<br />
He'll fly half flay'd with fear. Do you remember,<br />
And, as I bade you, give fair room for boasting,<br />
And take you care to know the taste of the guests;<br />
For as in any other market, so<br />
This is the goal which all your art should seek,<br />
To run straight into all the feasters' mouths<br />
As into harbour. At the present moment<br />
We're busied about a marriage feast&mdash;<br />
An ox is offer'd as the choicest victim;<br />
The father-in-law is an illustrious man,<br />

Their wives are priestesses to the good goddess.<br />
Corybantes, flutes, a crowd of revellers<br />
Are all assisting at the festival.<br />
Here's an arena for our noble art.<br />
Always remember this.

<p>And concerning another cook (whose name is Seuthes) the same poet
speaks in the following manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Seuthes, in the opinion of those men,<br />
Is a great bungler. But I'd have you know,<br />
My excellent friend, the case of a good cook<br />
Is not unlike that of a general.<br />
The enemy are present,&mdash;the commander,<br />
A chief of lofty genius, stands against them,<br />
And fears not to support the weight of war:&mdash;<br />
Here the whole band of revellers is the enemy,<br />
It marches on in close array, it comes<br />
Keen with a fortnight's calculation<br />
Of all the feast: excitement fires their breasts,<br />
They're ready for the fray, and watch with zeal<br />

Think now, that such a crowd collected sits<br />
To judge of your performance.

Will use each meat when it is most in season;<br />
And he who knows them not, but acts at random,<br />
Is always laugh'd at most deservedly.<br />
Perhaps, too, you don't know wherein the science<br />
Of th' architect can bear on this our art.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Indeed I wonder'd what it had to do with it.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I'll tell you:&mdash;rightly to arrange the kitchen,</span><br />

<div class="sidenote-left">COOKS.</div>

<p>23. And the cook in the Milesians of Alexis is not very different from
this, for he speaks as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Do you not know, that in most arts and trades</span><br />
'Tis not th' artificer who alone has pow'r<br />
O'er their enjoyment? Those who use them too<br />
Contribute all their part, if well they use them.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> How so? Let me, O stranger, understand.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> The duty of the cook is but to dress</span><br />
And rightly season meat; and nothing more.<br />
If, then, the man who is to eat his meat,<br />
And judge of it, comes in proper time,<br />
He aids the cook in that his business.<br />
But if he come too late, so that the joint<br />
Already roasted must be warm'd again,<br />
Or if he come too soon, so that the cook<br />
Is forced to roast the meat with undue haste,<br />
He spoils the pleasure which he might have had<br />
From the cook's skill by his unpunctuality.<br />
I class a cook among philosophers;<br />
You're standing round; my fire is alight;<br />
See how the numerous dogs of Vulcan's pack<br />
Leap to the roof; . . . . .<br />
. . . . . . You know what happens next:<br />
And so some unforeseen necessity<br />
Has brought on us alone this end of life.
</div>

<p>24. But Euphron, whom I mentioned a little while ago, O judges, (for I
do not hesitate to call you judges, while awaiting the decision of your
sense,) in his play called the Brothers, having represented a certain
cook as a well-educated man of extensive learning, and enumerating
all the artists before his time, and what particular excellence each
of them had, and what he surpassed the rest in, still never mentioned
anything of such a nature as I have frequently prepared for you.
Accordingly, he speaks as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I have, ere this, had many pupils, Lycus,<br />
Because I've always had both wit and knowledge;<br />
But you, the youngest of them all, are now<br />
Leaving my house an all-accomplish'd cook<br />
In less than forty weeks. There was the Rhodian<br />
Agis, the best of cooks to roast a fish;<br />
Nereus, the Chian, could a conger boil<br />
Fit for the gods: Charides, of Athens,<br />
Black broth was first devised by Lamprias;<br />
Sausages rich we owe to Aphthonetus;<br />
Euthunus taught us to make lentil soup;<br />
Aristion made out whole bills of fare<br />
For those who like a picnic entertainment.<br />
So, like those grave philosophers of old,<br />
These are our seven wisest of all cooks.<br />
But I, for all the other ground I saw<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 598]</span>

Had been pre-occupied by former artists,<br />
First found out how to steal, in such a way<br />
That no one blamed me, but all sought at once<br />
T' engage my aid. And you, perceiving too<br />
This ground already occupied by me,<br />
Invented something new yourself&mdash;'tis this:&mdash;<br />
Five days ago the Tenians, grey old men,<br />
After a tedious voyage o'er the sea,<br />
Did hold a sacrifice: a small thin kid:<br />
Lycus could crib no portion of that meat,<br />
Nor could his master. You compell'd the men<br />
To furnish two more kids. For as they long<br />
And oft survey'd the liver of the victims,<br />
You, letting down one unperceived hand,<br />
Were impudent enough to throw the kidneys<br />
Into the ditch: you raised a mighty tumult:<br />
"The victim has no kidneys," they exclaim'd,<br />
And all look'd downcast at th' unusual want.<br />
They slew another, and again I saw<br />
You eat the heart from out this second victim.<br />
You surely are a mighty man; you know it&mdash;<br />
For you alone have found a way to hinder<br />
A wolf (<ins title="Greek: lykon">λύκον</ins>) from opening his mouth in vain.<br />
And<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
yesterday you threw some strings of sausages<br />
(Which you had sought all day) into the fire,<br />
And sang to the dichordon. And I witness'd<br />
That play of yours; but this is merely sport.
</div>

<p>25. I wonder if it was any of these second seven wise men who contrived
this device about the pig, so as to stuff his inside without cutting
his throat, and so as to roast one side of him and boil the other at
the same time. And as we now urged and entreated him to explain this
clever device to us, he said,&mdash;I will not tell you this year, I swear
by those who encountered danger at Marathon, and also by those who
fought at Salamis. So when he had taken such an oath as that, we all
thought we ought not to press the man; but all began to lay hands
on the different dishes which were served up before us. And Ulpian
said,&mdash;I swear by those who encountered danger at Artemisium, no one
shall taste of anything before we are told in what ancient author the
word <ins title="Greek: parapherô">παραφέρω</ins> is used in the sense of serving up. For as
to the word <ins title="Greek: geumata">γεύματα</ins>, I think I am the only person who knows
anything about that. And Magnus said, Aristophanes in his Proagon says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 599]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE USE OF PARTICULAR WORDS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Why did you not desire him to place<br />
The goblets on the board (<ins title="Greek: parapherein">παραφέρειν</ins>)?
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his Female Actresses, uses the word in a more general
sense, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O Cocoas, bring (<ins title="Greek: paraphere">παράφερε</ins>) me now a goblet full.
</div>

<p>And Plato, in his Laced&aelig;monians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let him bring forward (<ins title="Greek: parapheretô">παραφερέτω</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Pamphila, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He laid the table, then he placed on it (<ins title="Greek: parapherôn">παραφέρων</ins>)<br />
Good things in wagon loads.
</div>

<p>But concerning the word <ins title="Greek: geumata">γεύματα</ins>, meaning anything which is
tasted, food, the exclusive knowledge about which you have claimed for
yourself, it is time for you now to tell us, O Ulpian, what you do
know. For as to the verb <ins title="Greek: geusai">γεῦσαι</ins>, we have that in Eupolis, in
his Goats, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Take now of this, and taste (<ins title="Greek: geusai">γεῦσαι</ins>) it.
</div>

<p>And Ulpian said, Ephippus in his Peltastes says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There there were stations for the horses and asses,<br />
And wine to drink (<ins title="Greek: geumata oinôn">γεύματα οἴνων</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Twins, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now he drinks wine (<ins title="Greek: oinogeustei">οἰνογευστεῖ</ins>) and walks about in splendour,<br />
Wreathed with flowery garlands.
</div>

<p>26. On this the cook said&mdash;I, then, will relate to you now, not
an ancient contrivance, but a device of my own, in order that
the flute-player may escape being beaten; (for Eubulus, in his
Laced&aelig;monians or Leda, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But I have heard of this, I swear by Vesta,<br />
That when the cook at home makes any blunder,<br />
The flute-player is always beaten for it.
</div>

<p>And Philyllius, or whoever the poet may have been who wrote the play of
The Cities, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Whatever blunders now the cook may make,<br />
The flute-player receives the stripes for them.)
</div>

<p>And I mean the device about the pig half-roasted, half-boiled, and
stuffed, without having had any apparent incision made in him. The
fact is, the pig was stuck with a very short wound under his shoulder;
(and he showed the wound.) Then when the greater part of the blood
had flowed from it, all the entrails, with the intestines, I washed
(and the word <ins title="Greek: exairesis">ἐξαίρεσις</ins>, O you revellers who think so much of
words, means not only a taking out, but also the entrails themselves)

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 600]</span>

carefully in wine several times, and hung the pig up by his feet. Then
again I washed him in wine; and having boiled up beforehand all the
seasonings which I have spoken of with a good deal of pepper, I pushed
them in at his mouth, pouring in afterwards a quantity of broth very
carefully made. And after this I plastered over one half of the pig, as
you see, with a great quantity of barley-meal, having soaked that in
wine and oil. And then I put it in an oven, placing under it a brazen
table, and I roasted it at a gentle fire, so as not to burn it, nor, on
the other hand, to take it away before it was quite done. And when the
skin began to get roasted and brown, I conjectured that the other side
was boiled enough. And so then I took off the barley-meal, and brought
it up in that condition and set it before you.</p>

<p>27. But as to the word <ins title="Greek: exairesis">ἐξαίρεσις</ins>, my excellent friend Ulpian,
Dionysius the comic poet, in his drama called Things having the same
Name, speaks thus, representing a cook speaking to his pupils&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come now, O Dromon, if you aught do know,<br />
Wise or accomplish'd in your business,<br />

I'm leading you into an enemy's country;<br />
Come gaily to the charge. They'll weigh the meat<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">LEARNED COOKS.</div>

<p>28. And so when we had all praised the cook for the
readiness of his discourse, and for the exceeding perfection of his
skill, our excellent entertainer Laurentius said&mdash;And how much better
it is for cooks to learn such things as these, than as they do with
one whom I could mention of our fellow-citizens, who having had his
head turned by riches and luxury, compelled his cooks to learn the
dialogues of the incomparable Plato, and when they were bringing in
dishes to say, "One, two, three, but where is the fourth, O most
excellent Tim&aelig;us, of those who were guests yesterday, but who are hosts
to-day?" Then another made answer, "An illness has overtaken him, O
Socrates,"&mdash;and so they went through the whole dialogue in this manner,
so that those who were at the feast were very indignant, and so that
that all-accomplished man was laughed at and insulted every day, and
that on this account many most respectable men refused all invitations
to his entertainments. But these cooks of ours, who are perhaps just as
well instructed in these things as he was, give us no little pleasure.
And then the slave who had been praised for his cleverness as a cook,
said,&mdash;Now what have my predecessors ever devised or told us of a
similar kind to this? and is not my behaviour moderate enough, since
I do not boast myself? And yet Coroebus the Elean, who was the first
man who ever was crowned as victor in the Olympic games, was a cook;
and yet he was not as proud of his skill and of his art as the cook in
Straton in the Ph&oelig;nicides, concerning whom the man who had hired him
speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p>29.</p>
<div class="topspace-2">
<div class="blockindent">
'Tis a male sphinx, and not a cook, that I<br />
Seem to have introduced into my house.<br />
For by the gods I swear there's not one thing<br />
Of all he says that I can understand,<br />
So full is he of fine new-fangled words.<br />
For when he first came in, he, looking big,<br />
Ask'd me this question&mdash;"How many <ins title="Greek: meropes">μέροπες</ins><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> now<br />
Have you invited here to dinner? Tell me."&mdash;<br />
"How many <ins title="Greek: meropes">μέροπες</ins> have I ask'd to dinner?"&mdash;<br />
"You're angry."&mdash;"Do you think that I'm a man<br />
To have acquaintance with your <ins title="Greek: meropes">μέροπες̣</ins>?<br />
It is a fine idea, to make a banquet<br />
And ask a lot of <ins title="Greek: meropes">μέροπες</ins> to eat it."<br />
"Then do you mean there'll be no <ins title="Greek: daitymôn">δαιτύμων</ins> (guest)?"<br />
"No D&aelig;tymon that I know of."&mdash;Then I counted&mdash;<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 602]</span>

There'll be Philinus, and Niceratus,<br />
And Moschion, and this man too, and that&mdash;<br />
And so I counted them all name by name;<br />
But there was not a D&aelig;tymon among them.<br />
"No D&aelig;tymon will come," said I. "What! no one?"<br />
Replied he in a rage, as though insulted<br />
That not a D&aelig;tymon had been invited.<br />
"Do you not slay that tearer up of th' earth,"<br />
Said he, "the broad-brow'd ox?" "In truth, not I;<br />
I've got no ox to kill, you stupid fellow."<br />
"Then you will immolate some sheep?" "Not I,<br />
By Jove; nor ox, nor sheep, but there's a lamb."<br />
"What! don't you know, said he, that lambs are sheep?"<br />
"Indeed," said I, "I neither know nor care<br />
For all this nonsense. I'm but country bred;<br />
So speak more plainly, if you speak at all."<br />
"Why, don't you know that this is Homer's language?"<br />
"My good cook, Homer was a man who had<br />
A right to call things any names he pleased;<br />
But what, in Vesta's name, is that to us?"<br />
"At least you can't object when I quote him."<br />
"Why, do you mean to kill me with your Homer?"<br />
"No, but it is my usual way of talking."<br />
"Then get another way, while here with me."<br />
"Shall I," says he, "for your four dirty drachmas,<br />
Give up my eloquence and usual habits?<br />
Well, bring me here the <ins title="Greek: oulochytai">οὐλόχυται</ins>." "Oh me!<br />
What are <ins title="Greek: oulochytai">οὐλόχυται̣</ins>?" "Those barley-cakes."<br />
"You madman, why such roundabout expressions?"<br />
"Is there no sediment of the sea at hand?"<br />
"Sediment? Speak plain; do tell me what you want<br />
In words I understand." "Old man," says he,<br />
"You are most wondrous dull; have you no salt?<br />
That's sediment, and that you ought to know;<br />
Bring me the basin."&mdash;So they brought it. He<br />
Then slew the animals, adding heaps of words<br />
Which not a soul of us could understand,<br />
<ins title="Greek: Mistylla">μίστυλλα</ins>, <ins title="Greek: moiras">μοίρας</ins>,

So that I took Philetas' Lexicon down,<br />
To see what each of all these words did mean.<br />
And then once more I pray'd of him to change,<br />
And speak like other men; by earth I swear,<br />
Persuasion's self could not have work'd on him.

<div class="sidenote-left">COOKS.</div>

<p>30. But the race of cooks are really very curious for the most
part about the histories and names of things. Accordingly the most
learned of them say, "The knee is nearer than the leg,"&mdash;and, "I
have travelled over Asia and Europe:" and when they are finding fault
with any one they say, "It is impossible to make a Peleus out of an
&OElig;neus."&mdash;And I once marvelled at one of the old cooks, after
I had enjoyed his skill and the specimens of his art which he had
invented. And Alexis, in his Caldron, introduces one speaking in the
following manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> He boil'd, it seem'd to me, some pork, from off</span><br />
A pig who died by suffocation.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> That's nice.</span><br />
<span class="linespace4"><i>A.</i> And then he scorch'd it at the fire.</span><br />

For while 'tis hot 'twill draw the moisture up<br />
Through its material, which is porous all;<br />
And so fermenting, like a pumice-stone,<br />
'Twill open all its spongy passages,<br />
Through which it will imbibe new moisture thoroughly.<br />
And so the meat will cease to seem dried up,<br />
But will be moist and succulent again.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> O Phoebus, what a great physician's here!</span><br />
O Glaucias!&mdash;I will do all you tell me.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> And serve them, when you do serve them up,</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> It seems to me you're fitter to write books</span><br />
Than to cook dinners; since you quibble much<br />
In all your speeches, jesting on your art.
</div>

<p>31. And now we have had enough of cooks, my feasters; lest perhaps some
one of them, pluming himself and quoting the Morose Man of Menander,
may spout such lines as these&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No one who does a cook an injury<br />
Ever escapes unpunish'd; for our art<br />
Is a divine and noble one.
</div>

<p>But I say to you, in the words of the tuneful Diphilus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I place before you now a lamb entire,<br />
Well skewer'd, and well cook'd and season'd;<br />
Some porkers in their skins, and roasted whole;<br />
And a fine goose stuff'd full, like Dureus.
</div>

<p>32. We must now speak of the goose. For as many geese were served
up very excellently dressed, some one said, Look at the fat geese (<ins title="Greek: siteutoi chênes">σιτευτοὶ χῆνες</ins>).
And Ulpian said, Where do you ever
find the expression <ins title="Greek: siteutos chên">σιτευτὸς χήν̣</ins>? And Plutarch answered

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 604]</span>

him:&mdash;Theopompus the Chian, in his History of Greece, and in the
thirteenth book of his History of the Affairs and Exploits of Philip,
says that the Egyptians sent to Agesilaus the Laced&aelig;monian, when he
arrived in Egypt, some fatted (<ins title="Greek: siteutous">σιτευτοὺς</ins>) calves and geese
(<ins title="Greek: chênas">χῆνας</ins>). And Epigenes the comic poet says in his Bacchanalian
Women&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But if a person were to take me like<br />
A fatted goose (<ins title="Greek: chêna siteuton">χῆνα σιτευτόν</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Archestratus, in that celebrated poem of his, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And at the same time dress the young of one<br />
Fat goose (<ins title="Greek: siteutou chênos">σιτευτοῦ χῆνος</ins>), and let him too be roasted<br />
<span class="linespace1">thoroughly.</span>
</div>

<p>But we have a right now, O Ulpian, to expect you to tell us, you who
question everybody about everything, where this very costly dish of the
livers of geese has been mentioned by any ancient writer. For Cratinus
is a witness that they were acquainted with people whose business it
was to feed geese, in his Dionysalexander, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Geese-feeders, cow-herds . . . .
</div>

<p>And Homer uses the word <ins title="Greek: chên">χὴν</ins> in both the masculine and
feminine gender; for he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: Aietos argên chêna pherôn">Αἰετὸς ἀργὴν χῆνα φέρων</ins>&mdash;An eagle carrying off a lazy goose.
</div>

<p>And again he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And as he seized a fine home-fatten'd goose (<ins title="Greek: chêna atitallomenên">χῆνα ἀτιταλλομένην</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I've twenty geese, fond of the lucid stream,<br />
Who in my house eat wheat, and fatten fast.
</div>

<p>And Eupolis mentions the livers of geese (and they are thought an
excessive delicacy at Rome), in his Women Selling Garlands, where he
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If you have not a goose's liver or heart.
</div>

<p>33. There were also heads of pigs split in half and served up as a
dish. And this dish is mentioned by Crobylus, in his Son falsely held
to be Supposititious&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There came in half a head of a young pig,<br />
A tender dish; and I did stick to it<br />
So close, by Jove, that I left none of it.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 605]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE USE OF PARTICULAR WORDS.</div>

<p>After these things there was served up a haricot, called <ins title="Greek: kreôkakkabos">κρεωκάκκαβος</ins>.
And this dish consists of meat chopped up with blood and
fat, in a sauce richly sweetened; and Aristophanes the Grammarian says
that it was the Ach&aelig;ans who
gave this name to the dish. But Anticlides, in the seventy-eighth book
of his Returns, says, "Once when there was a design on the part of the
Erythreans to put the Chians to death by treachery at a banquet, one of
them having learnt what was intended to be done, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O Chians, wondrous is the insolence<br />
Which now has seized the Erythreans' hearts.<br />
Flee when you've done your pork&mdash;don't wait for beef.
</div>

<p>And Aristomenes, in his Jugglers, makes mention in the following terms
of boiled meat, which he calls <ins title="Greek: anabrasta krea">ἀναβραστὰ κρέα</ins>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>They used also to eat the testicles of animals, which they called
<ins title="Greek: nephroi">νέφροι</ins>.&mdash;Philippodes, in his Renovation, speaking of the
gluttony of Gnath&aelig;na the courtesan, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then, after all these things, a slave came in,<br />
Bearing a large dish full of testicles;<br />
And all the rest of the girls made prudish faces,<br />
But fair Gnath&aelig;na, that undoer of men,<br />
Laughed, and said, "Capital things are testicles,<br />
I swear by Ceres." So she took a pair<br />
And ate them up: so that the guests around<br />
Fell back upon their chairs from laughing greatly.

<p>34. And when some one said that a cock dressed with a sauce of oil
and vinegar (<ins title="Greek: oxyliparon">ὀξυλίπαρον</ins>) was a very good bird, Ulpian, who was fond
of finding fault, and who was reclining on a couch by himself, eating
little, but watching the rest of the guests, said&mdash;What is that
<ins title="Greek: oxyliparon">ὀξυλίπαρον</ins> you speak of? unless indeed you give that name to the
small figs called <ins title="Greek: kottana">κόττανα</ins> and lepidium, which are both national food
of mine.&mdash;But Timocles, he replied, the comic poet, in his play
called The Ring, mentions<ins title="Greek: oxyliparon"> ὀξυλίπαρον</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And sharks and rays and all the other fish,<br />
Which may be dressed in sauce of <ins title="Greek: oxyliparon">ὀξυλίπαρον</ins>.

<p>And Alexis has called some men <ins title="Greek: akroliparoi">ἀκρολίπαροι</ins>, fat on the

<div class="blockindent">

</div>

<p>And once when a large fish was served up in sour pickle (<ins title="Greek: oxalmê">ὀξάλμν</ins>),
and somebody said that every fish (<ins title="Greek: opsarion">ὀψάριον</ins>) was best when dressed
in this kind of pickle, Ulpian, picking out the small bones, and
contracting his brows, said,—here do you find the word <ins title="Greek: oxalmê">ὀξάλμη̣</ins> And
as to <ins title="Greek: opsarion">ὀψάριον</ins>, I am quite sure that that is a word used by no living
author. However, at that time the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 606]</span>

guests all desired him to settle that as he pleased, and themselves
preferred eating; while Cynulcus quoted these lines out of the Breezes
of Metagenes&mdash;</p>

<p>But Myrtilus in a pleasant manner declared that he subscribed to
Ulpian's sentiments, so as to be willing to have nothing to eat, as
long as he might talk; and said;&mdash;Cratinus, in his Ulysseses, has
mentioned <ins title="Greek: oxalmê">ὀξάλμη</ins>, in the following lines&mdash;</p>

It is not right to cheat us in this way,<br />

<div class="blockindent">
I now, O Dion, will buy you some fish (<ins title="Greek: opsarion">ὀψάριον</ins>).

<p>Where, however, perhaps we must take <ins title="Greek: opsaria">ὀψάρια</ins> as used synonymously
with <ins title="Greek: prosopsônêmata">προσψωήματα</ins>, for made dishes in general. For Alexis, in his Woman
Sitting up all Night, represents a cook as speaking in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Do you prefer your high made dishes hot,</span><br />
Or cold, or something just between the two?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Cold.</span><br />

<span class="linespace7"><i>A.</i> I'll tell you now, for I</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> The man will kill me with his endless questions.</span>
</div>

<p>36. These passages I have quoted to you on the part of us who are still
alive, my well-fed friend Ulpian. For you too, as it seems to me, agree
so far with Alexis as to eat no living animals. And Alexis, in his
Attic Woman, speaks in the following manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The man who first did say that no philosopher<br />
Would eat of living things, was truly wise.<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 608]</span>

For I am just come home, and have not bought<br />
A living thing of any kind. I've bought<br />
Some fish, but they were dead, and splendid fish.<br />
Then here are joints of well-fed household lamb,<br />
But he was kill'd last week. What else have I?<br />
Oh, here's some roasted liver. If there be<br />
A man who can this liver prove to have<br />
Or soul or voice or animation,<br />
I will confess I've err'd and broken the law.
</div>

<p>So now after all this let us have some supper. For just see, while I am
talking to you, all the pheasants have flown by me, and are gone out of
reach, disregarding me, because of your unseasonable chattering. But I
should like you to tell me, my master Myrtilus, said Ulpian, where you
got that word <ins title="Greek: olbiogastôr">ὀλβιογάστωρ</ins>, and also whether any ancient author
mentions the pheasant, and I&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Rising at early morn to sail . . . .
</div>

<p>not through the Hellespont, but into the market-place, will buy a
pheasant which you and I may eat together.</p>

<p>37. And Myrtilus said,&mdash;On this condition I will tell you. Amphis uses
the word <ins title="Greek: olbiogastôr">ὀλβιογάστωρ</ins> in his Gyn&aelig;comania, where he speaks as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Eurybates, you hunter of rich smells,<br />
You surely are the most well-fed (<ins title="Greek: olbiogastôr">ὀλβιογάστωρ</ins>) of men.
</div>

<p>And as for the bird called the pheasant, that delicious writer
Aristophanes mentions it in his play called The Birds. There are in
that play two old Athenians, who, from their love of idleness, are
looking for a city where there is nothing to do, that they may live
there; and so they take a fancy to the life among the birds. And
accordingly they come to the birds: and when all of a sudden some
wild bird flies towards them, they, alarmed at the sight, comfort one
another, and say a great many things, and among them they say this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> What now is this bird which we here behold?</span><br />
Will you not say?<br />
<span class="linespace6_5"><i>B.</i> I think it is a pheasant.</span>
</div>

<p>And I also understand the passage in the Clouds to refer to birds, and
not to horses as many people take it&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The Phasian flocks, bred by Leogoras.
</div>

<p>For it is very possible that Leogoras may have bred horses and
pheasants too. And Leogoras is also turned into ridicule as a gourmand
by Plato in his Very Miserable Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 609]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PHEASANTS.</div>

<p>And Mnesimachus, in his play called Philip, (and Mnesimachus is one of
the poets of the Middle Comedy,) says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And as the proverb runs, it is more rare<br />
Than milk of birds, or than a splendid pheasant<br />
Artistically pluck'd.
</div>

<p>And Theophrastus the Eresian, a pupil of Aristotle, mentions them
in the third book of his Treatise on Animals, speaking nearly as
follows&mdash;"There is also some such difference as this in birds. For
the heavy birds which are not so well-suited for flying, such as the
woodcock, the partridge, the cock, and the pheasant, are very well
adapted for walking and have thick plumage." And Aristotle, in the
eighth book of his History of Animals, writes thus:&mdash;"Now of birds
there are some which are fond of dusting themselves, and some which are
fond of washing, and some which neither dust nor wash themselves. And
those which are not good flyers, but which keep chiefly on the ground,
are fond of dusting themselves; such as the common fowl, the partridge,
the woodcock, the pheasant, the lark." Speusippus also mentions them in
the second book of his treatise on Things Resembling one another. And
the name these men give the pheasant is <ins title="Greek: phasianos">φασιανὸς</ins>, not <ins title="Greek: phasianikos">φασιανικός</ins>.</p>

<p>38. But Agatharchides of Cnidos, in the thirty-fourth book of his
History of the Affairs of Europe, speaking of the river Phasis, writes
as follows:&mdash;"But the great multitude of the birds called pheasants
(<ins title="Greek: phasianoi">φασιανοι</ins>) come for the sake of food to the places where
the mouths of the rivers fall into the sea." And Callixenus the
Rhodian, in the fourth book of his Account of Alexandria, describing
a procession which took place in Alexandria, when Ptolemy who was
surnamed Philadelphus was king, mentions, as a very extraordinary
circumstance connected with these birds&mdash;"Then there were brought
on in cases parrots, and peacocks, and guinea-fowl, and pheasants,
and an immense number of &AElig;thiopian birds." And Artemidorus the pupil
of Aristophanes, in his book entitled The Glossary of Cookery, and
Pamphilus the Alexandrian, in his treatise on Names and Words,
represents Ep&aelig;netus as saying in his Cookery Book that the pheasant
is also called <ins title="Greek: tatyras">τατύρας</ins>. But Ptolemy Euergetes, in the second
book of his Commentaries, says that the pheasant is called <ins title="Greek: tetartos">τατύρας</ins>.
Now this is what I am able to tell you about the pheasant,
which I have seen brought up on your account, as if we all had fevers.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 610]</span>

But you, if you do not, according to your agreement, give me to-morrow
what you have covenanted to, I do not say that I will prosecute you in
the public courts for deceit, but I will send you away to live near the
Phasi, as Polemon, the Describer of the World, wished to drown Ister
the pupil of Callimachus, the historian, in the river of the same name.</p>

<p>39. The next thing to be mentioned is the woodcock. Aristophanes, in
his Storks, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The woodcock, most delicious meat to boil,<br />
Fit dish for conqueror's triumphal feast.
</div>

<p>And Alexander the Myndian says that it is a bird a little larger
than a partridge, and spotted all over the back, about the colour of
earthenware, but a little more ruddy. And it is caught by the hunters,
because it is a heavy flyer in consequence of the shortness of its
wings; and it is a bird fond of dusting itself, and very prolific, and
it feeds on seeds.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But Socrates, in his treatise on Boundaries,
and Places, and Fire, and Stones, says,&mdash;"The woodcock having been
transported into Egypt from Lydia, and having been let loose in the
woods there, for some time uttered a sound like a quail: but after the
river got low, and a great scarcity arose, in which a great many of the
natives of the country died, they never ceased uttering, as they do
to this day, in a voice more distinct than that of the very clearest
speaking children, 'Threefold evils to the wicked doers.' But when they
are caught it is not only impossible to tame them, but they even cease
to utter any sound at all; but if they are let go again, they recover
their voice." And Hipponax mentions them thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Not eating woodcocks or the timid hare.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Birds, mentions them also. And in his
Acharnians he speaks of them as being very common in the district
about Megara.And the Attic writers circumflex the noun in a manner quite
contrary to analogy. For words of more than two syllables ending in
<ins title="Greek: as">ας</ins>, when the final <ins title="Greek: a">α</ins> is long, are barytones; as for instance, <ins title="Greek: akamas">ἀκάμας</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: Sakadas">Σακάδας</ins>, <ins title="Greek: adamas">ἀδάμας</ins>. And we ought also to read the plural <ins title="Greek: attagai">ἀττάγαι</ins>, and not
<ins title="Greek: attagênes">ἀτταγῆνες</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 611]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE PORPHYRION.</div>

<p>40. There is also a bird called the porphyrion. And it is well known
that this bird is mentioned by Aristophanes. And Polemo, in the fifth
book of his treatise addressed to Antigonus and Ad&aelig;us, says that the
bird called the porphyrion, when it is kept in a house, watches those
women who have husbands very closely; and has such instantaneous
perception of any one who commits adultery, that, when it perceives
it, it gives notice of it to the master of the house, cutting its own
existence short by hanging itself. And, says he, it never partakes of
food before it has walked all round the place seeking for some spot
which may suit it; and then it dusts itself there, and washes itself,
and after that it feeds. And Aristotle says that it has cloven feet,
and that it is of a dark blue colour, with long legs, with a beak of
a scarlet colour beginning at its very head; of about the size of
a cock of the common poultry breed; and it has a small gullet, on
which account it seizes its food with its foot, and divides it into
diminutive morsels. And it drinks greedily; and it has five toes on
each foot, of which the middle one is the largest. But Alexander the
Myndian, in the second book of his treatise on the History of Birds,
says that the bird comes originally from Libya, and that it is sacred
to the gods of Libya.</p>

<p>There is also another bird called the porphyris. Callimachus, in his
treatise on Birds, says that the porphyris is different from the
porphyrion, and enumerates the two birds separately. And he says that
the porphyrion takes its food while hiding itself in darkness, so that
no one may see it; for it hates those who come near its food. And
Aristophanes also mentions the porphyris in his drama entitled The
Birds. And Ibycus speaks of some birds which he calls lathiporphyrides,
and says; "There are some variegated ducks with purple necks which
frequent the highest branches of the trees; and the birds called
lathiporphyrides with variegated necks, and king-fishers with extended
wings." And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You're always bearing me aloft, my mind,<br />
Like some bold porphyris, with out-stretch'd wings.
</div>

<p>41. The next bird is the partridge. A great many authors mention this
bird, as also does Aristophanes. And some of them in the oblique cases

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 612]</span>

shorten the penultima of the noun; as Archilochus does where he writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: ptôssousan hôs te perdika">πτώσσουσαν ὥς τε πέρδῖκα</ins>,
</div>

<p>in the same way as <ins title="Greek: ortyga">ὄρτῦγα</ins> and <ins title="Greek: choinika">χοίνῖκα</ins> have the penultima short. But it
is usually made long by the Attic writers. Sophocles, in his Camici,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A man arrived, who in the famous hills<br />
Of Attica is a namesake of the partridge (<ins title="Greek: perdikos">πέρδι:κος</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Pherecrates, or whoever it was who wrote the Chiron, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He goes against his will, like any partridge (<ins title="Greek: perdikos tropon">πέρδικος τρόπον</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Phrynichus, in his Tragedians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And Cleombrotus the son of Perdix (<ins title="Greek: Perdikos">Πέρδικος</ins>),
</div>

<p>(for the bird is sometimes cited as a model of lasciviousness).</p>

<p>Nicophon, in his Handicraftsmen, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The hepseti, and all those partridges (<ins title="Greek: perdikas">περδι:κας</ins>).
</div>

<p>But Epicharmus, in his Revellers, uses the word with the penultima
short, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They brought in cuttle-fish, who swim the deep,<br />
And partridges (<ins title="Greek: perdikas">πέρδικας</ins>) who fly in lofty air.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle gives the following account of the bird&mdash;"The partridge
is a land bird, with cloven feet; and he lives fifteen years: but the
female lives even more. For among all birds the female lives longer
than the male. It lays eggs, and hatches its young itself, as the
common hen does. And when it is aware that it is being hunted, it comes
away from its nest, and rolls near the legs of the huntsman, giving him
a hope that he may catch it; and so it deceives him, until its young
have flown away, and then it flies away itself also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 613]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PARTRIDGES.</div>

<p>42. "But it is a very ill-disposed and cunning animal; and moreover
it is much devoted to amatory enjoyments; on which account it breaks
the eggs of its hen, that it may not be deprived of her while she is
hatching them; and therefore the hen, knowing this, runs away and hides
her eggs." And Callimachus gives the same account in his treatise on
Birds. And the single birds fight with one another, and the one which
is defeated becomes the mate of the conqueror. But Aristotle says that
they all in turn use the bird which has been defeated as their mate,
and that the tame birds also
take the wild ones for their mates. And the bird which is defeated by
the other patiently allows itself to be treated by him as his mate.
And this happens at a particular time of the year, as is also stated
by Alexander the Myndian. And they lay their eggs on the ground, both
the cocks and the hens making themselves separate nests. And the
leader of the wild birds attacks the decoy partridge, and when he is
taken another comes forward to fight the decoy bird; and this is done
whenever the bird used for the decoy is a cock bird; but when a hen
is employed for the purpose, then she crows till the leader of the
wild birds meets her, and the rest of the wild birds assemble and
drive him away from the hen, because he is attending to her and not
to them; on which account sometimes he advances without making any
noise, in order that no other bird may hear his voice and come to
fight him. And sometimes the hen also checks the crowing of the cock
as he comes up:<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and very often when she is sitting on her nest she
gets off it on perceiving the cock approaching the decoy bird, and
remains there to receive his embraces in order to draw him away from
the decoy bird. And so very eager to propagate their species are both
quails and partridges, that they fall into the hands of the hunters
on that account, sitting on the tiles. They say, too, that when hen
partridges are taken out to hunt, even when they see or smell a cock
standing or flying down the wind, become pregnant, and some say that
they immediately begin to lay eggs. And about breeding time they fly
about with their mouths open, putting out their tongues, both hens and
cocks. And Clearchus says, in his treatise on Panic Fear,&mdash;"Sparrows
and partridges, and also the common barn-door fowl and the quail,
are eager to propagate their species, not only the moment that they
see the hen, but even as soon as they hear her voice. And the cause
of this is the excessive impression made on their minds by amatory
pleasures and proximity. And you may see more easily all that takes
place with respect to the propagation of their species if you put a
looking-glass opposite to them. For they run forward, being deceived
by the appearance, and behave as if they saw a hen, and so are caught.
Only the common poultry cock does not do so. But the perception of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 614]</span>

reflected image operates on them only so far as to make them wish to
fight." And this is the statement of Clearchus.</p>

<p>43. Partridges are by some people called <ins title="Greek: kakkabai">κάκκαβαι</ins>, as, for
instance, by Alcman, who speaks as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Alcman, too, began the strain;<br />
And he introduced into the language<br />
The compound name of <ins title="Greek: kakkabides">κακκαβίδες</ins>:
</div>

<p>showing plainly enough that he had learnt to compound the word from the
noise made by partridges. On which account also Cham&aelig;leon of Pontus
said that the discovery of music was originally made by the ancients
from the birds singing in desert places; by imitation of whom they
arrived at the art of music; but it is not all partridges who make
the noise called <ins title="Greek: kakkabizein">κακκαβίζειν</ins>, or cackling. At all events,
Theophrastus, in his treatise on the Different Noises made by Animals
of the same Species, says&mdash;"The partridges in Attica, near Corydallus,
on the side towards the city, cackle; but those on the other side
twitter." And Basilis, in the second book of his History of India,
says&mdash;"The diminutive men in those countries which fight with cranes
are often carried by partridges." And Menecles, in the first book of
his Collectanea, says&mdash;"The pygmies fight both with partridges and with
cranes." But there is a different kind of partridge found in Italy, of
a dark colour on its wings, and smaller in size, with a beak inclining
in the smallest possible degree to a red colour. But the partridges
about Cirrha are not at all nice to eat as to their flesh, on account
of the nature of their food. But the partridges in Boeotia either do
not cross into Attica at all, or else, whenever they do, they are
easily recognised by their voices, as we have previously mentioned. But
the partridges which are found in Paphlagonia, Theophrastus says, have
two hearts. But those in the island of Sciathos feed on cockles. And
sometimes they have as many as fifteen or sixteen young at a time; and
they can only fly short distances, as Xenophon tells us in the first
book of his Anabasis, where he writes,&mdash;"But if any one rouses the
bustard suddenly it is easy to catch him; for they can only fly a short
distance, like partridges, and they very soon tire; but their flesh is
very delicious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 615]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE BUSTARD.</div>

<p>44. And Plutarch says that Xenophon is quite correct about the bustard;
for that great numbers of these birds are brought to
Alexandria from the adjacent parts of Libya; being hunted and caught
in this manner. The animal is a very imitative one, the bustard; being
especially fond of imitating whatever it sees a man do; and accordingly
it does whatever it sees the hunters do. And they, standing opposite
to it, anoint themselves under the eyes with some unguent, having
prepared other different unguents calculated to close up the eyes and
eyelids; and these other unguents they place in shallow dishes near the
bustards. And so the bustards, seeing the men anoint themselves under
the eyes, do the same thing also themselves, taking the unguents out of
these dishes; and by this means they are quickly caught. And Aristotle
writes the following account of them:&mdash;"It is a migratory bird, with
cloven feet, and three toes; of about the size of a large cock, of the
colour of a quail, with a long head, a sharp beak, a thin neck, large
eyes, a bony tongue, and it has no crop." But Alexander the Myndian
says that it is also called also called <ins title="Greek: lagôdίass"> λαγωδίας</ins>. And he says, also,
that it ruminates, and that it is very fond of the horse; and that if
any one puts on a horse's skin he can catch as many as he pleases;
for they come up to him then of their own accord. And presently, in
another passage, Aristotle tells us, "The bustard is something like
the owl, but it is not a bird which flies by night; and it has large
feathers about its ears, on which account it is called <ins title="Greek: ôtos">ὦτος</ins>, from <ins title="Greek: ôta">ὦτα</ins>;
and it is about the size of a pigeon, and a great
imitator of mankind; and accordingly it is caught by dancing opposite
to them." And it is in shape something like a man, and it is an
imitator of whatever man does. On which account the comic poets call
those people who are easily taken in by any one whom they chance to
meet, a bustard. Accordingly, in hunting them, the man who is cleverest
at it, stands opposite to them and dances; and the birds, looking at
the man dancing, move like puppets pulled by strings; and then some
one comes behind them, and, without being perceived, seizes on them
while they are wholly occupied with the delight they derive from the
imitation.</p>

<p>45. They say, also, that the screech-owl does the same thing: for
it is said that they also are caught by dancing. And Homer mentions
them. And there is a kind of dance, which is called <ins title="Greek: skôps">σκὼψ</ins>,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 616]</span>

or the screech-owl, from them; deriving its name from the variety of
motion displayed by this animal. And the screech-owls also delight in
imitation, and it is from their name that we say that those men <ins title="Greek: skôptousi">σκώπτουσι</ins>,
who keep looking at the person whom they wish to turn into
ridicule, and mock all his conduct by an exact imitation, copying the
conduct of those birds. But all the birds whose tongues are properly
formed, and who are capable of uttering articulate sounds, imitate
the voices of men and of other birds; as the parrot and the jay. The
screech-owl, as Alexander the Myndian says, is smaller than the common
owl, and he has whitish spots on a leaden-coloured plumage; and he
puts out two tufts of feathers from his eyebrows on each temple. Now
Callimachus says that there are two kinds of screech-owls, and that
one kind does screech, and the other does not&mdash;on which account
one kind is called <ins title="Greek: skôpes">σκῶπες</ins>, and the other kind is called <ins title="Greek: aeiskôpes">ἀείσκωπες</ins>, and
these last are of a grey colour.</p>

<p>But Alexander the Myndian says that the name is written in Homer,
<ins title="Greek: kôpes">κῶπες</ins> without the <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins>, and that that was the name which
Aristotle gave them; and that they are constantly seen, and that they
are not eatable; but that those which are only seen about the end of
autumn for a day or two are eatable. And they differ from the <ins title="Greek: aeiskôpes">ἀείσκωπες</ins> in their speed,
and they are something like the turtle-dove
and the pigeon in pace. And Speusippus, in the second book of his
treatise on Things Resembling one another, also calls them <ins title="Greek: kôpes">κῶπες</ins>
without the <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins>. But Epicharmus writes <ins title="Greek: skôpas">σκῶπας</ins>, epopses
and owls. And Metrodorus, in his treatise on Custom and
Habituation, says, that the screech-owl is caught by dancing opposite
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 617]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">SPARROWS.</div>

<p>46. But since, when we were talking of partridges, we mentioned that
they were exceedingly amorous birds, we ought also to add, that the
cock of the common poultry fowl is a very amorous bird too; at all
events Aristotle says, that when cocks are kept in the temples as being
dedicated to the Gods, the cocks who were there before treat any new
comer as a hen until another is dedicated in a similar manner. And if
none are dedicated, then they fight together, and the one which has
defeated the other works his will on the one which he has defeated.
It is related, also, that a cock, whenever he goes in at any door
whatever, always stoops his crest, and that
one cock never yields to another without a battle; but Theophrastus
says, that the wild cocks are still more amorous than the tame ones,
he says, also, that the cocks are most inclined to pursue the hens the
moment they leave their perch in the morning, but the hens prefer it as
the day advances.</p>

<p>Sparrows, also, are very amorous birds; on which account Terpsicles
says, that those who eat sparrows are rendered exceedingly prone to
amorous indulgences; and perhaps it is from such an idea that Sappho
represents Venus as being drawn by sparrows yoked in her chariot;
for they are very amorous birds, and very prolific. The sparrow has
about eight young ones at one hatching, according to the statement of
Aristotle. And Alexander the Myndian says that there are two kinds of
sparrows, the one a tame species, and the other a wild one; and he adds
that the hen-sparrow is weaker in other respects, and also that their
beaks are of a more horny colour, and that their faces are not very
white, nor very black; but Aristotle says that the cock-sparrow never
appears in the winter, but that the hen-sparrows remain, drawing his
conclusions as to what he thinks probable from their colour; for their
colour changes, as the colour of blackbirds and of coots does, who get
whiter at certain seasons. But the people of Elis call sparrows <ins title="Greek: deirêtai">δείρηται</ins>,
as Nicander the Colophonian tells us in the third book of
his treatise on Different Dialects.</p>

<p>47. We must also speak of the quail; they are called <ins title="Greek: ortyges">ὄρτυγες</ins>.
And here there arises a general question about words ending in <ins title="Greek: yx">υξ</ins>,
why the words with this termination do not all have the same letter
as the characteristic of the genitive case. I allude to <ins title="Greek: ortyx">ὄρτυξ</ins> and
<ins title="Greek: onyx">ὄνυξ</ins>. For the masculine simple nouns ending in <ins title="Greek: x">ξ</ins> when the vowel <ins title="Greek: y">υ</ins>
precedes <ins title="Greek: x">ξ</ins>, and when the last syllable begins with any one of the
immutable consonants or those which are characteristic of the first<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> conjugation of barytone verbs, make the genitive
with <ins title="Greek: k">κ</ins>; as <ins title="Greek: kêryx kêrykos">κῆρυξ κήρυκος</ins>, <ins title="Greek: pelyx pelyko">πέλυξ πέλυκος</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Eryx erykos">Ἔρυξ ἔρυκος</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: Bebryx">Βέβρυξ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Bebrykos">Βέβρυκος</ins>; but those
which have not this characteristic make the genitive with a <ins title="Greek: g">γ</ins>, as
<ins title="Greek: ortyx ortygos">ὄρτυξ ὄρτυγος</ins>, <ins title="Greek: kokkyx kokkygos">κόκκυξ κόκκυγος</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: oryx orygos">ὄρυξ ὄρυγος</ins>; and there is one word
with a peculiar inflexion, <ins title="Greek: onyx onychos">ὄνυξ ὄνυχος</ins>; and as a general rule, in the
nominative case plural, they follow the genitive case singular in
having the same characteristic of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 618]</span>

last syllable. And the case is the same if the last syllable does
not begin with a consonant at all.</p>

<p>But with respect to the quail Aristotle says, "The quail is a migratory
bird, with cloven feet, and he does not make a nest, but lies in the
dust; and he covers over his hole with sticks for fear of hawks; and
then the hen lays her eggs in the hole." But Alexander the Myndian
says, in the second book of his treatise on Animals, "The female quail
has a thin neck, not having under its chin the same black feathers
which the male has. And when it is dissected it is found not to have a
large crop, but it has a large heart with three lobes; it has also its
liver and its gall-bladder united in its intestines, but it has but a
small spleen, and one which is not easily perceived; and its testicles
are under its liver, like those of the common fowl." And concerning
their origin, Phanodemus, in the second book of his History of Attica,
says:&mdash;"When Erysichthon saw the island of Delos, which was by the
ancients called Ortygia, because of the numerous flocks of quails which
came over the sea and settled in that island as one which afforded
them good shelter . . . ." And Eudoxus the Cnidian, in the first book of
his Description of the Circuit of the Earth, says that the Phoenicians
sacrifice quails to Hercules, because Hercules, the son of Asteria
and Jupiter, when on his way towards Libya, was slain by Typhon and
restored to life by Iolaus, who brought a quail to him and put it to
his nose, and the smell revived him. For when he was alive he was, says
Eudoxus, very partial to that bird.</p>

<p>48. But Eupolis uses the word in its diminutive form, and in his play
called Cities, calls them <ins title="Greek: ortygia">ὀρτύγια</ins>, speaking as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Tell me now, have you ever bred any <ins title="Greek: ortyges">ὄρτυγες̣</ins>?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> I've bred some small <ins title="Greek: ortygia">ὀρτύγια</ins>. What of that?</span>
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his play called The Countryman, speaks as follows,
using also the form <ins title="Greek: ortygion">ὀρτύγιον</ins>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For what now could a man like you perform,<br />
Having the soul of a quail (<ins title="Greek: ortygiou">ὀρτυγίου</ins>)?
</div>

<p>It is an odd expression that Pratinas uses, who in his Dym&aelig;n&aelig;, or
the Caryatides, calls the quail a bird with a sweet voice, unless
indeed quails have voices in the Phliasian or Laced&aelig;monian country
as partridges have; and perhaps it is from this, also, that the bird
called <ins title="Greek: sialis">σίαλις</ins> has its name, as
Didymus says. For nearly all birds derive their names from the sounds
which they make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 619]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">QUAILS.</div>

<p>There is also a bird called the <ins title="Greek: ortygomêtra">ὀρτυγομήτρα</ins> (which is
mentioned by Crates in his Chirons, where he says,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The <ins title="Greek: ortygomêtra">ὀρτυγομήτρα</ins> came from Ithaca.)
</div>

<p>And Alexander the Myndian also mentions it, and says that in size it
is nearly equal to a turtle-dove; that it has long legs, a slender
body, and is very timid. And with respect to the hunting for quails,
Clearchus the Solensian mentions some very singular circumstances,
in his book which is entitled "A Treatise on those things which have
been asserted on Mathematical Principles in Plato's Polity," where
he writes as follows&mdash;"Quails, about breeding time, if any one puts
a looking-glass opposite to them, and a noose in front of it, run
towards the bird which is seen in the looking-glass; and so fall into
the noose." And about the birds called jackdaws he makes a similar
statement, saying&mdash;"And a very similar thing happens to the jackdaws,
on account of their naturally affectionate disposition towards each
other. For they are a most exceedingly cunning bird; nevertheless when
a bowl full of oil is placed near them, they stand on the edge of the
bowl, and look down, and then rush down towards the bird which appears
visible in the liquid. In consequence of which, when they are soaked
through with the oil, their wings stick together and cause them to be
easily captured." And the Attic writers make the middle syllable of
the oblique cases of <ins title="Greek: ortyx">ὄρτυξ</ins> long, like <ins title="Greek: doidyka">δοίδῦκα</ins>,
and <ins title="Greek: kêryka">κήρῦκα</ins>; as Demetrius Ixion
tells us, in his treatise on the Dialect of the Alexandrians. But Aristophanes,
in his Peace, has used the word with the penultima short for the sake
of the metre, writing&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The tame domestic quails (<ins title="Greek: ortyges oikogeneis">ὄρτῦγες οἰκογενεῖς</ins>).
</div>

<p>There is also a bird called <ins title="Greek: chennion">χέννιον</ins>, which is a small kind
of quail, which is mentioned by Cleomenes, in his letter to Alexander,
where he expresses himself in the following manner&mdash;"Ten thousand
preserved coots, and five thousand of the kind of thrush called tylas,
and ten thousand preserved <ins title="Greek: chennia">χέννια</ins>." And Hipparchus, in his
Egyptian Iliad, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I cannot fancy the Egyptian life,<br />
Plucking the chennia, which they salt and eat.
</div>

<p>49. And even swans in great plenty were not wanting to our banquets.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 620]</span>

And Aristotle speaks in the following manner of this bird&mdash;"The swan
is a prolific bird, and a quarrelsome one. And, indeed, they are so
fond of fighting that they often kill one another. And the swan will
fight even the eagle; though he does not begin the battle himself. And
they are tuneful birds, especially towards the time of their death. And
they also cross the seas singing. And they are web-footed, and feed
on herbage." But Alexander the Myndian says, that though he followed
a great many swans when they were dying, he never heard one sing. And
Hegesianax of Alexandria, who arranged the book of Cephalion, called
the History of Troy, says that the Cycnus who fought with Achilles in
single combat, was fed in Leucophrys by the bird of the same name, that
is, by the swan. But Boius, or Boio, which Philochorus says was his
proper name, in his book on the Origin of Birds, says that Cycnus was
turned into a bird by Mars, and that when he came to the river Sybaris
he was cooped with a crane. And he says, also, that the swan lines his
nest with that particular grass which is called lyg&aelig;a.</p>

<p>And concerning the crane (<ins title="Greek: geranos">γέρανος</ins>), Boius says that there was
among the Pygmies a very well known woman whose name was Gerana. And
she, being honoured as a god by her fellow-countrymen, thought lightly
of those who were really gods, and especially of Juno and Diana. And
accordingly Juno, being indignant, metamorphosed her into an unsightly
bird, and made her hostile to and hated by the Pygmies who had been
used to honour her. And he says, also, that of her and Nicodamas was
born the land tortoise. And as a general rule, the man who composed all
these fables asserts that all the birds were formerly men.</p>

<p>50. The next bird to be mentioned is the pigeon. Aristotle says, that
there is but one genus of the pigeon, but five subordinate species;
writing thus&mdash;"The pigeon, the œnas, the phaps, the dove, and the
turtle-dove." But in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of
Animals, he makes no mention of the phaps, though &AElig;schylus, in his
tragedy called Proteus, does mention that bird in the following line&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Feeding the wretched miserable phaps,<br />
Entangled as to its poor broken sides<br />
Within the winnowing spokes.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 621]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PIGEONS.</div>

<p>And in his Philoctetes he uses the word in the genitive case plural, <ins title="Greek: phabôn">φαβῶν</ins>.
"The œnas, then," says Aristotle, "is something
larger than the pigeon, and it has a puce-coloured plumage; but the
phaps is something between the pigeon and the œnas. And the species
called phassa is about as large as the common cock, but of the colour
of ashes; and the turtle-dove is less than all the other species, and
is of a cinder-colour. And this last is only seen in the summer, and
during the winter it keeps in its hole. Now, the phaps and the common
pigeon are always to be seen, but the œnas is only visible in the
autumn. And the species called the phassa is said to be longer lived
than any of the others; for it lives thirty or forty years. And the
cock birds never leave the hens to the day of their death, nor do
the hens ever desert the cock: but when one dies the other remains
solitary: and crows, and ravens, and jackdaws all do the same thing.
And in every kind of the genus pigeon, both male and female sit on
the eggs in turn; and when the chickens are hatched, the cock bird
spits upon them to prevent their being fascinated. And the hen lays
two eggs, the first of which produces a cock and the second a hen. And
they lay at every season of the year; so that they lay ten or eleven
times a-year; and in Egypt they lay twelve times; for the hen conceives
again the very next day to that in which it lays." And further on, in
the same book, Aristotle says that the kind called <ins title="Greek: peristera">περιστερὰ</ins> differs from
the <ins title="Greek: peleias">πελειὰς</ins>, and the <ins title="Greek: peleias">πελειὰς</ins> is the least of the two. And the <ins title="Greek: peleias">πελειὰς</ins> is easily
tamed; but the <ins title="Greek: peristera">περιστερὰ</ins> is black, and small, and has red rough legs; on
which account no one keeps them. But he mentions a peculiarity of the species called <ins title="Greek: peristera">περιστερὰ</ins>,
that they kiss one another when
courting, and that if the males neglect this, the hens do not admit
their embraces. However, old doves do not go through this formality;
but omit the kisses and still succeed in their suit, but the younger
ones always kiss before they proceed to action. And the hens, too,
make love to one another, when there is no cock at hand, kissing one
another beforehand. But still, as there are no real results, the eggs
which they lay never produce chickens. The Dorians, however, consider
the <ins title="Greek: peleias">πελειὰς</ins> and the <ins title="Greek: peristera">περιστερὰ</ins> as identical; and Sophron uses the two words
as synonymous in his Female Actresses. But Callimachus, in his treatise
on Birds, speaks of the pyrallis, the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 622]</span>

dove, the wood-pigeon, and the turtle-dove,
as all different from one another.</p>

<p>51. But Alexander the Myndian says, that the pigeon never lifts up
his head when it drinks, as the turtle-dove does; and that it never
utters any sound in the winter except when it is very fine weather.
It is said, also, that when the species called &oelig;nas has eaten the
seed of the mistletoe, and then leaves its droppings on any tree,
mistletoe after that grows upon that tree. But Daïmachus, in his
history of India, says that pigeons of an apple-green colour are found
in India. And Charon of Lampsacus, in his history of Persia, speaking
of Mardonius, and of the losses which the Persian army sustained off
Mount Athos, writes as follows&mdash;"And that was the first time that white
pigeons were ever seen by the Greeks; as they had never existed in
that country." And Aristotle says, that the pigeons, when their young
are born, eat a lot of earth impregnated with salt, and then open the
mouths of their young and spit the salt into them; and by this means
prepare them to swallow and digest their food.</p>

<p>And at Eryx in Sicily, there is a certain time which the Sicilians
call The Departure, at which time they say that the Goddess is
departing into Africa: and at this time all the pigeons about the place
disappear, as if they had accompanied the Goddess on her journey.And after
nine days, when the festival called <ins title="Greek: katagôgia">καταγώγια</ins>, that is
to say The Return, is celebrated, after one pigeon has first arrived,
flying across the sea like an <i>avant-courier</i>, and has flown into the
temple, the rest follow speedily. And on this, all the inhabitants
around, who are comfortably off, feast; and the rest clap their hands
for joy. And at that time the whole place smells of butter, which they
use as a sort of token of the return of the Goddess. But Autocrates,
in his history of Achaia, says that Jupiter once changed his form
into that of a pigeon, when he was in love with a maiden in &AElig;gium,
whose name was Phthia. But the Attic writers use the word also in the
masculine gender, <ins title="Greek: peristeros">περιστερός</ins>. Alexis, in his People Running
together, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For I am the white pigeon <ins title="Greek: peristeros">(περιστερὸς</ins>) of Venus;<br />
But as for Bacchus, he knows nothing more<br />
Than how to get well drunk; and nothing cares<br />
Whether 'tis new wine that he drinks or old.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 623]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DUCKS.</div>

<p>But in his play of the Rhodian, or the Woman Caressing, he uses the
word in the feminine gender; and says in that passage that the Sicilian
pigeons are superior to all others&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Breeding within some pigeons from Sicily,<br />
The fairest shaped of all their species.
</div>

<p>And Pherecrates, in his Painters, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Send off a pigeon (<ins title="Greek: peristeron">περιστερὸν</ins>) as a messenger.
</div>

<p>And in his Petale he uses the diminutive form <ins title="Greek: peristerion">περιστέριον</ins>,
where he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But now, my pigeon, fly thou like Callisthenes,<br />
And bear me to Cythera and to Cyprus.
</div>

<p>And Nicander, in the second book of his Georgics, mentions the Sicilian
doves and pigeons, and says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And do you in your hall preserve a flock<br />
Of fruitful doves from Sicily or Dracontium,<br />
For it is said that neither kites nor hawks<br />
Incline to hurt those choice and sacred birds.
</div>

<p>52. We must also mention ducks. The male of these birds, as Alexander
the Myndian says, is larger than the female, and has a more richly
coloured plumage: but the bird which is called the glaucion, from the
colour of its eyes, is a little smaller than the duck. And of the
species called boscades the male is marked all over with lines, and
he also is less than the duck; and the males have short beaks, too
small to be in fair proportion to their size: but the small diver is
the least of all aquatic birds, being of a dirty black plumage, and
it has a sharp beak, turning upwards towards the eyes, and it goes a
great deal under water. There is also another species of the boscades,
larger than the duck, but smaller than the chenalopex: but the species
which are called phascades are a little larger than the small divers,
but in all other respects they resemble the ducks. And the kind called
uria are not much smaller than the duck, but as to its plumage it is
of a dirty earthenware colour, and it has a long and narrow beak: but
the coot, which also has a narrow beak, is of a rounder shape, and is
of an ash colour about the stomach, and rather blacker on the back.
But Aristophanes, in his Acharnians, in the following lines, mentions
the duck and the diver, from whose names (<ins title="Greek: nêtta">νῆττα</ins> and <ins title="Greek: kolymbas">κολυμβὰς</ins>) we get the
verbs <ins title="Greek: nêchomai">νήχομαι</ins>, to swim, and <ins title="Greek: kolymbaô">κολυμβάω</ins>, to dive, with a great many other
water birds&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 624]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
Ducks too, and jackdaws, woodcocks too, and coots,<br />
And wrens, and divers.
</div>

<p>And Callimachus also mentions them in his treatise on Birds.</p>

<p>53. We often also had put before us the dish called parastat&aelig;, which
is mentioned by Ep&aelig;netus in his Cookery Book, and by Semaristus in
the third and fourth books of his treatise on Synonymes. And it is
testicles which are called by this name. But when some meat was served
up with a very fragrant sauce, and when some one said,&mdash;Give me a plate
of that suffocated meat, that D&aelig;dalus of names, Ulpian, said&mdash;I myself
shall be suffocated if you do not tell me where you found any mention
of meat of that kind; for I will not name them so before I know. And he
said, Strattis, in his Macedonians or Cinesias, has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Take care, and often have some suffocated meat.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus, in his Catacollomenos, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And platters heap'd with quantities of meat<br />
Suffocated in the Sicilian fashion.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Some suffocated meat in a platter.
</div>

<p>And Cratinus, in his Delian Women, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And therefore do you take some meat and pound it,<br />

an inquiry respecting them, whether they were mentioned by any ancient
author, some one said&mdash;Pherecrates, in his Slave turned Tutor, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I stole some sucking-pigs not fully grown.

<p>And Herodotus, in his first book, says that in Babylon there is a

sucking-pigs. Antiphanes says in his Philet&aelig;rus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And Clearchus, in his Lives, says that Phalaris the tyrant had arrived

that is the derivation of the word <ins title="Greek: titthos">τίτσθος</ins>, breast, from <ins title="Greek: tithêmi">τίθημι</ins>, to

collector of words, said&mdash;It is not bad meat that of the antelopes
(<ins title="Greek: dorkônes">δόρκωνες</ins>). And Myrtilus said to him&mdash;The word is only <ins title="Greek: dorkades">δορκάδες</ins>,
not <ins title="Greek: dorkônes">δόρκωνες</ins>. Xenophon, in the first book of his

Anabasis, says, "And there were in that part bustards and <ins title="Greek: dorkades">δορκάδες</ins>."</p>

<p>56. The next thing to be mentioned is the peacock. And that this is a
rare bird is shown by what Antiphanes says in his Soldier, or Tychon,
where his words are&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then some man brought in one single pair<br />
Of peacocks to the city; 'twas a sight<br />
Wondrous to see; now they're as thick as quails.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus says in his Phoenix&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The peacock is admired for his rarity.
</div>

<p>"The peacock," says Aristotle, "is cloven-footed, and feeds on herbage;
it begins to breed when it is three years old, at which age it also
gets the rich and varied colours of its plumage; and it sits on its
eggs about thirty days, and once a-year it lays twelve eggs, and it
lays these not all at once, but at intervals, laying every third day.
But the first year of a hen's laying she does not lay more than eight
eggs; and she sometimes lays wind eggs like the common hen, but never
more than two; and she sits upon her eggs and hatches them very much
in the same way as the common hen does." And Eupolis, in his Deserters
from the Army, speaks of the peacock in the following terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Lest I should keep in Pluto's realm,<br />
A peacock such as this, who wakes the sleepers.
</div>

<p>And there is a speech extant, by Antiphanes the orator, which is
entitled, On Peacocks. And in that speech there is not one express
mention of the name peacock, but he repeatedly speaks of them in it
as birds of variegated plumage, saying&mdash;"That Demus, the son of
Pyrilampes, breeds these birds, and that out of a desire to see these
birds, a great many people come from Laced&aelig;mon and from Thessaly,
and show great anxiety to get some of the eggs." And with respect to
their appearance he writes thus&mdash;"If any one wishes to remove
these birds into a city, they will fly away and depart; and if he cuts
their wings he takes away their beauty. For their wings are their
beauty, and not their body." And that people used to be very anxious
to see them he tells us subsequently in the same book, where he says;
"But at the time of the festival of the new moon, any one who likes is
admitted to see them, but on other days if any one comes and wishes to
see them he is never allowed to do so; and this is not a custom of
yesterday, or a recent practice, but one which has subsisted for more
than thirty years."</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE ATTIC FORM OF NOUNS IN <ins title="Greek: ÔS">ΩΣ</ins>.</div>

<p>57. "But the Athenians call the word <ins title="Greek: taôs">ταῶς</ins>," as Tryphon
tells us, "circumflexing and aspirating the last syllable. And they
read it spelt in this way in the Deserters from the Army of Eupolis,
in the passage which has been already quoted, and in the Birds of
Aristophanes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Are you then Tereus? are you a bird or a peacock (<ins title="Greek: taôs">ταῶς</ins>)?
</div>

<p>And in another passage he writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A bird then; what kind? is it not a peacock (<ins title="Greek: taôni">ταῶς</ins>)?
</div>

<p>But in the dative they say <ins title="Greek: taôni">ταὧνι</ins>, as Aristophanes does in the same
play. But it is quite impossible in the Attic or Ionic dialects that,
in nouns which have more than one syllable, the last syllable beginning
with a vowel should be aspirated; for it is quite inevitable that it
should be pronounced with a lene breathing, as <ins title="Greek: neôs">νεὢς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: leôs">λεὢς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Tindareôs">Τυνδάρεὠς</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: Meneleôs">Μενέλεὠς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: leiponeôs">λειπόνεὠς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: euneôs">εὔνεὠς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Neileôs">Νείλεὠς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: praos">πρᾶὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: hyios">ὑίὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Keios">Κεῖὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: Chios">χῖὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: dios">δῖὀς</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: chreios">χρεῖὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: pleios">πλεῖὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: leios">λεῖὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: laios">λαιὄς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: baios">βαιὂς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: phaios">φαιὂς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: hyios">πηὂς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: goos">γόὀς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: thoos">θοὂς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: rhoos">ῥόὀς</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: zôos">ζωὄς</ins>. For the aspirate is fond of beginning a word, and is by nature
inclined to the lead, and is never included in the last part of a word.
And the name <ins title="Greek: taôs">ταὧς</ins> is derived from the extension (<ins title="Greek: tasis">τάσις</ins>) of the wings."
And Seleucus, in the fifth book of his treatise
on Hellenisms, says: "The peacock, <ins title="Greek: taôs">ταὧς</ins>:&mdash;but the Attics, contrary to all rule, both aspirate
and circumflex the last syllable; but the aspirate is only attached
to the first vowel when it begins a word in the simple pronunciation
of the word, and there taking the lead, and running on more swiftly,
it has the first place in the word. Accordingly, the Athenians, in
consequence of this arrangement, observing the inherent character of
this breathing, do not put it <i>on</i> vowels, as they do often accents and
breathings, but put it before them. And I think that the ancients used
to mark the aspirate by the character H, on which account the Romans
write the letter H at the beginning of all aspirated nouns, showing
its predominant nature; and if this be the proper character of the
aspirate, it is plain that it is contrary to all reason and analogy
that the word <ins title="Greek: taôs">ταῶς</ins> has any breathing at all marked upon it by
the Attic writers."</p>

<p>58. And as at the banquet a great many more discussions arose about
each of the dishes that were served up;&mdash;But I, said Laurentius,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 628]</span>

according to the example of our most excellent friend Ulpian, will
myself also say something to you (for we are feeding on discussions).
What do you think of the grouse? And when some one said,&mdash;He is a
species of bird; (but it is the custom of the sons of the grammarians
to say of anything that is mentioned to them in this way, It is a
species of plant, a species of bird, a species of stone;) Laurentius
said&mdash;And I, my good friend, am aware that the admirable Aristophanes,
in his Birds, mentions the grouse in the following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
With the porphyrion and the pelican,<br />
And pelecinnus, and the phlexis too,<br />
The grouse and peacock.
</div>

<p>But I wish to learn from you whether there is any mention of the
bird in any other author. For Alexander the Myndian, in the second
book of his treatise on Winged Animals, speaks of it as a bird of
no great size, but rather as one of the smaller birds. For his
words are these&mdash;"The grouse, a bird about the size of rook,
of an earthenware colour, variegated with dirty coloured spots, and
long lines, feeding on fruit; and when it lays its eggs t cackles
(<ins title="Greek: tetrazei">τετράζει</ins>). from which it derives its name (<ins title="Greek: tetrax">τέτραξ</ins>)." And Epicharmus,
in his Hebe's Wedding, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For when you've taken quails and sparrows too,<br />
And larks who love to robe themselves in dust,<br />
And grouse, and rooks, and beauteous fig-peckers.
</div>

<p>And in another passage he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There were the herons with their long bending necks,<br />
A numerous flock; and grouse, and rooks besides.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 629]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LOINS.</div>

<p>But since none of you have anything to say on the subject (as you
are all silent), I will show you the bird itself; for when I was the
Emperor's Procurator in Mysia, and the superintendent of all the
affairs of that province, I saw the bird in that country. And learning
that it was called by this name among the Mysians and P&aelig;onians, I
recollected what the bird was by the description given of it by
Aristophanes. And believing that this bird was considered by the
all-accomplished Aristotle worthy of being mentioned in that work of
his worth many talents (for it is said that the Stagirite received
eight hundred talents from Alexander as his contribution towards
perfecting his History of Animals), when I found that there was no
mention of it in this work, I was delighted at having the
admirable Aristophanes as an unimpeachable witness in the matter. And
while he was saying this, a slave came in bringing in the grouse in a
basket; but it was in size larger than the largest cock of the common
poultry, and in appearance it was very like the porphyrion; and it had
wattles hanging from its ears on each side like the common cock; and
its voice was loud and harsh. And so after we had admired the beauty of
the bird, in a short time one was served up on the table dressed; and
the meat of him was like that of the ostrich, which we were often in
the habit of eating.</p>

<p>59. There was a dish too called loins (<ins title="Greek: psyai">ψύαι</ins>). The poet who
wrote the poem called The Return of the Atrid&aelig;, in the third book says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And with his rapid feet Hermioneus<br />
Caught Nisus, and his loins with spear transfix'd.
</div>

<p>And Simaristus, in the third book of his Synonymes, writes thus: "The
flesh of the loins which stands out on each side s called <ins title="Greek: psyai">ψύαι</ins>, and
the hollows on each side they call <ins title="Greek: kyboi">κύβοι</ins> and <ins title="Greek: galliai">γάλλιαι</ins>." And Clearchus,
in the second book of his treatise on The Joints in the Human Body,
speaks thus: "There is flesh full of muscle on each side; which some
people call <ins title="Greek: psyai">ψύαι</ins>, and others call <ins title="Greek: alôpekes">ἀλώπεκες</ins>, and others <ins title="Greek: neuromêtrai">νευρόμητραι</ins>."
And the admirable Hippocrates also speaks of <ins title="Greek: psyai">ψύαι</ins>; and they get this
name from being easily wiped (<ins title="Greek: apo tou rhadiôs apopsasthai">ἀπὸ τοῦ ῥαδίως ἀποψᾶσθαι</ins>), or as being
flesh lightly touching (<ins title="Greek: epipsauousa">ἐπιψαύουσα</ins>) the bones, and lying lightly on the
surface of them. And Euphron the comic poet mentions them in his Theori&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is a lobe and parts, too, called <ins title="Greek: psyai">ψύαι</ins>;<br />

<p>60. There is a dish too made of udder. Teleclides, in his Rigid Men,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Since I'm a female, I must have an udder.
</div>

<p>Herodotus, in the fourth book of his History, uses the same term when
speaking of horses; but it is rare to find the word (<ins title="Greek: outhar">οὖθαρ</ins>) applied to
the other animals; but the word most commonly used is <ins title="Greek: hypogastrion">ὑπογάστριον</ins>, as
in the case of fishes. Strattis, in his Atalanta, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The <ins title="Greek: hypogastrion">ὑπογάστριον</ins> and the extremities<br />
Of the large tunny.

<p>And Theopompus, in his Call&aelig;schrus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 630]</span></p>

<p>But in the Sirens he calls it not <ins title="Greek: hypogastria">ὑπογάστρια</ins>, but <ins title="Greek: hypêtria">ὑπήτρια</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Th' <ins title="Greek: hypêtria">ὑπήτρια</ins> of white Sicilian tunnies.

<p>61. We must now speak of the hare; concerning this animal Archestratus,
that author so curious in his dishes, speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Many are the ways and many the recipes<br />
For dressing hares; but this is best of all,<br />
To place before a hungry set of guests,<br />
A slice of roasted meat fresh from the spit,<br />
Hot, season'd only with plain simple salt,<br />
Not too much done. And do not you be vex'd<br />
At seeing blood fresh trickling from the meat,<br />
But eat it eagerly. All other ways<br />
Are quite superfluous, such as when cooks pour<br />
A lot of sticky clammy sauce upon it,<br />
Parings of cheese, and lees, and dregs of oil,<br />
As if they were preparing cat's meat.
</div>

<p>And Naucrates the comic poet, in his Persia, says that it is an
uncommon thing to find a hare in Attica: and he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For who in rocky Attica e'er saw<br />
A lion or any other similar beast,<br />
Where 'tis not easy e'en to find a hare?
</div>

<p>But Alc&aelig;us, in his Callisto, speaks of hares as being plentiful, and
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You should have coriander seed so fine<br />
That, when we've got some hares, we may be able<br />
To sprinkle them with that small seed and salt.
</div>

<p>62. And Tryphon says,&mdash;"Aristophanes, in his Danaides, uses the form
<ins title="Greek: lagôn">λαγὼν</ins> in the accusative case with an acute accent on the last
syllable, and with a <ins title="Greek: n">ν</ins> for the final letter, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And when he starts perhaps he may be able<br />
To help us catch a hare (<ins title="Greek: lagôn">λαγών</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in his Daitaleis he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I am undone, I shall be surely seen<br />
Plucking the fur from off the hare (<ins title="Greek: lagôn">λαγών</ins>).
</div>

<p>But Xenophon, in his treatise on Hunting, writes the accusative <ins title="Greek: lagô">λαγω</ins>
without the <ins title="Greek: n">ν</ins>, and with a circumflex accent. But among us the ordinary
form of the nominative case is <ins title="Greek: lagôs">λαγός</ins>; and as we say <ins title="Greek: naos">ναὸς</ins>, and the
Attics <ins title="Greek: neôs">νεὼς</ins>, and as we say <ins title="Greek: laos">λαὸς</ins>, and the Attics <ins title="Greek: leôs">λεώς</ins>; so, while we call
this animal <ins title="Greek: lagos">λαγὸς</ins>, they call him <ins title="Greek: lagôs">λαγώς</ins>. And as for our using the form
<ins title="Greek: lagon">λαγὸν</ins> in the accusative case singular, to that we find a corresponding
nominative plural in Sophocles, in his Amycus, a satyric drama; where
he enumerates&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 631]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">HARES.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Cranes, crows, and owls, and kites, and hares (<ins title="Greek: lagoi">λαγοι</ins>).
</div>

<p>But there is also a form of the nominative plural corresponding to
the accusative <ins title="Greek: lagôn">λαγὼν</ins>, ending in <ins title="Greek: ô">ω</ins>, as found in the
Flatterers of Eupolis&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Where there are rays, and hares (<ins title="Greek: lagô">λαγὼ</ins>), and light-footed women.
</div>

<p>But some people, contrary to all reason, circumflex the last
syllable of this form <ins title="Greek: lagô">λαγώ</ins>; but it ought to have an acute accent, since
all the nouns which end in <ins title="Greek: os">ος</ins>, even when they are changed into <ins title="Greek: ôs">ως</ins>
by the Attic writers, still preserve the same accent as if they had
undergone no alteration; as <ins title="Greek: naos, neôs">ναὸς, νεώς</ins>; <ins title="Greek: kalos, kalôs">κάλος, κάλως</ins>. And so, too,
Epicharmus used this noun, and Herodotus, and the author of the poem
called the Helots. Moreover, <ins title="Greek: lagos">λαγὸς</ins> is the Ionic form&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Rouse the sea-hare (<ins title="Greek: lagos">λαγὸς</ins>) before you drink the water;
</div>

<p>and <ins title="Greek: lagôs">λαγὼς</ins> the Attic one. But the Attic writers use also the form
<ins title="Greek: lagos">λαγός</ins>; as Sophocles, in the line above quoted&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Cranes, crows, and owls, and hares (<ins title="Greek: lagoi">λαγοι</ins>).
</div>

<p>There is also a line in Homer, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: ê ptôka lagôon">ἢ πτῶκα λαγωόν</ins>.
</div>

<p>Now, if we have regard to the Ionic dialect, we say that <ins title="Greek: ô">ω</ins> is
interpolated; and if we measure it by the Attic dialect, then we say
the <ins title="Greek: o">ο</ins> is so: and the meat of the hare is called <ins title="Greek: lagôa
krea">λαγῶα κρέα</ins>.</p>

<p>63. But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, says that in
the reign of Antigonus Gonatas, there were such a number of hares in
the island of Astypal&aelig;a, that the natives consulted the oracle on the
subject. And the Pythia answered them that they ought to breed dogs,
and hunt them; and so in one year there were caught more than six
thousand. And all this immense number arose from a man of the island
of Anaphe having put one pair of hares in the island. As also, on a
previous occasion, when a certain Astypal&aelig;an had let loose a pair of
partridges in the island of Anaphe, there came to be such a number of
partridges in Anaphe, that the inhabitants ran a risk of being driven
out of the island by them. But originally Astypal&aelig;a had no hares at
all, but only partridges. And the hare is a very prolific animal,
as Xenophon has told us, in his treatise on Hunting; and Herodotus

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 632]</span>

speaks of it in the following terms&mdash;"Since the hare is hunted by
everything&mdash;man, beast, and bird&mdash;it is on this account a very
prolific animal; and it is the only animal known which is capable of
superfetation. And it has in its womb at one time one litter with the
fur on, and another bare, and another just formed, and a fourth only
just conceived." And Polybius, in the twelfth book of his History, says
that there is another animal like the hare which is called the rabbit (<ins title="Greek: kouniklos">κούνικλος</ins>);
and he writes as follows&mdash;"The animal called the
rabbit, when seen at a distance, looks like a small hare; but when any
one takes it in his hands, there is a great difference between them,
both in appearance and taste: and it lives chiefly underground." And
Posidonius the philosopher also mentions them in his History; and we
ourselves have seen a great many in our voyage from Dic&aelig;archia<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
to Naples. For there is an island not far from the mainland, opposite the
lower side of Dic&aelig;archia, inhabited by only a very scanty population,
but having a great number of rabbits. And there is also a kind of
hare called the Chelidonian hare, which is mentioned by Diphilus, or
Calliades, in his play called Ignorance, in the following terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What is this? whence this hare who bears the name<br />
Of Chelidonian? Is it grey hare soup,<br />
Mimarcys call'd, so thick with blood?

are hares about Bisaltia which have two livers.</p>

<p>64. And when a wild boar was put upon the table, which was in no
respect less than that noble Calydonian boar which has been so much
celebrated,—I suggest to you now, said he, O my most philosophical and
precise Ulpian, to inquire who ever said that the Calydonian boar was a
female, and that her meat was white. But he, without giving the matter
any long consideration, but rather turning the question off, said—But
it does seem to me, my friends, that if you are not yet satisfied,
after having had such plenty of all these things, that you surpass
every one who has ever been celebrated for his powers of eating,—and
who those people are you can find out by inquiry. But it is more
correct and more consistent with etymology to make the name <ins title="Greek: sys">σὺς</ins>,
with a <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins>; for the animal has its name from rushing (<ins title="Greek: seuomai">σεύομαι</ins>) and going on
impetuously; but men have got a trick of pronouncing the word without
the <ins title="Greek: s, hys">ς, ὗς</ins>; and some people believe that it is called <ins title="Greek: syn">σῦν</ins>, by being
softened from <ins title="Greek: syn">θῦν</ins>, as if it had its name from being a fit animal to
sacrifice (<ins title="Greek: thyn">θύειν</ins>). But now, if it seems good to you, answer me who
ever uses the compound word like we do, calling the wild boar not
<ins title="Greek: sys agrios">σῦς ἄγριος</ins>, but <ins title="Greek: syagros">σύαγρος̣</ins> At all events, Sophocles, in his Lovers of
Achilles, has applied the word <ins title="Greek: syagros">σύαγρος</ins> to a dog, as hunting the boar
(<ins title="Greek: apo tou sys agreuein">ἀπὸ τοῦ σῦς ἀγρεύειν</ins>), where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And you, Syagre, child of Pelion.
</div>

<p>And in Herodotus we find Syagrus used as a proper name of a man who
was a Laced&aelig;monian by birth, and who went on the embassy to Gelon the
Syracusan, about forming an alliance against the Medes; which Herodotus
mentions in the seventh book of his History. And I am aware, too, that
there was a general of the &AElig;tolians named Syagrus, who is mentioned by
Phylarchus, in the fourth book of his History. And Democritus said&mdash;You
always, O Ulpian, have got a habit of never taking anything that is set
before you until you know whether the existing name of it was in use
among the ancients. Accordingly you are running the risk, on account
of all these inquiries of yours, (just like Philetas of Cos, who was
always investigating all false arguments and erroneous uses of words,)
of being starved to death, as he was. For he became very thin by reason
of his devotion to these inquiries, and so died, as the inscription in
front of his tomb shows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Stranger, Philetas is my name, I lie<br />
Slain by fallacious arguments, and cares<br />
Protracted from the evening through the night.
</div>

<p>65. And so that you may not waste away by investigating this word
<ins title="Greek: syagros">σύαγρος</ins>, learn that Antiphanes gives this name to the wild boar, in his
Ravished Woman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This very night a wild boar (<ins title="Greek: syagron">σύαγρον</ins>) will I seize,<br />
And drag into this house, and a lion and a wolf.
</div>

<p>And Dionysius the tyrant, in his Adonis, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Under the arched cavern of the nymphs<br />
I consecrate . . . .<br />
A wild boar (<ins title="Greek: syagron">σύαγρον</ins>) as the first-fruits to the gods.
</div>

<p>And Lynceus the Samian, in his epistle to Apollodorus, writes
thus&mdash;"That you may have some goat's flesh for your children, and some
meat of the wild boar (<ins title="Greek: ta syagria">τὰ συάγρια</ins>) for yourself and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 634]</span>

your friends." And Hippolochus the Macedonian, whom we have mentioned
before now, in his epistle to the above-named Lynceus, mentioned
many wild boars (<ins title="Greek: syagrôn">συάγρων</ins>). But, since you have turned off
the question which was put to you about the colour of the Calydonian
boar, and whether any one states him to have been white as to his
flesh, we ourselves will tell you who has said so; and you yourself
may investigate the proofs which I bring. For some time ago, I read
the dithyrambics of Cleomenes of Rhegium; and this account is given
in that ode of them which is entitled Meleager. And I am not ignorant
that the inhabitants of Sicily call the wild boar (which we call
<ins title="Greek: syagros aschedôros">σύαγρος) ἀσχέδωρος</ins>. And &AElig;schylus,
in his Phorcides, comparing Perseus to a wild boar, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He rush'd into the cave like a wild boar (<ins title="Greek: aschedôros hôs">ἀσχέδωρος ὥς</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Sciras (and he is a poet of what is called the Italian comedy, and
a native of Tarentum), in his Meleager, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Where shepherds never choose to feed their flocks,<br />
Nor does the wild boar range and chase his mate.
</div>

<p>And it is not wonderful that &AElig;schylus, who lived for some time in
Sicily, should use many Sicilian words.</p>

<p>66. There were also very often kids brought round by the servants,
dressed in various ways; some of them with a great deal of assafoetida,
which afforded us no ordinary pleasure; for the flesh of the goat is
exceedingly nutritious. At all events, Clitomachus the Carthaginian,
who is inferior to no one of the new Academy for his spirit of
philosophical investigation, says that a certain Theban athlete
surpassed all the men of his time in strength, because he ate goat's
flesh; for the juice of that meat is nervous and sticky, and such as
can remain a long time in the substance of the body. And this wrestler
used to be much laughed at, because of the unpleasant smell of his
perspiration. And all the meat of pigs and lambs, while it remains
undigested in the system, is very apt to turn, because of the fat. But
the banquets spoken of by the comic poets rather please the ears by
sweet sounds, than the palate by sweet tastes; as, for instance, the
feast mentioned by Antiphanes, in his Female Physician&mdash;</p>

<p>68. Now, after all this conversation, there was brought in the dish
which is called Rhoduntia; concerning which that wise cook quoted
numbers of tragedies before he would tell us what he was bringing us.
And he laughed at those who professed to be such admirable cooks,
mentioning whom, he said&mdash;Did that cook in the play of Anthippus,
the comic poet, ever invent such a dish as this?&mdash;the cook, I
mean, who, in the Veiled Man, boasted in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Sophon, an Ararnanian citizen,</span><br />
And good Democritus of Rhodes, were long<br />
Fellow-disciples in this noble art,<br />
And Labdacus of Sicily was their tutor.<br />
These men effaced all vulgar old recipes<br />
Out of their cookery books, and took away<br />
The mortar from the middle of the kitchen.<br />
They brought into disuse all vinegar,<br />
Cummin, and cheese, and assafoetida,<br />
And coriander seed, and all the sauces<br />
Which Saturn used to keep within his cruets.<br />
And the cook who employ'd such means they thought<br />
A humbug, a mere mountebank in his art.<br />
They used oil only, and clean plates, O father,<br />
And a quick fire, wanting little bellows:<br />
With this they made each dinner elegant.<br />
They were the first who banish'd tears and sneezing,<br />
And spitting from the board; and purified<br />
The manners of the guests. At last the Rhodian,<br />
Drinking some pickle by mistake, did die;<br />
For such a draught was foreign to his nature.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> 'Twas likely so to be.</span><br />
<span class="linespace8"><i>A.</i> But Sophon still</span><br />
Has all Ionia for his dominions,<br />
And he, O father, was my only tutor.<br />
And I now study philosophic rules,<br />
Wishing to leave behind me followers,<br />
And new discover'd rules to guide the art.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Ah! but, I fear, you'll want to cut <i>me</i> up,</span><br />
And not the animal we think to sacrifice.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> To-morrow you shall see me with my books,</span><br />
Seeking fresh precepts for my noble art;<br />
Nor do I differ from th' Aspendian.<br />
And if you will, you too shall taste a specimen<br />
Of this my skill. I do not always give<br />
The self-same dishes to all kinds of guests;<br />
But I regard their lives and habits all.<br />
One dish I set before my friends in love,<br />
Another's suited to philosophers,<br />
Another to tax-gatherers. A youth<br />
Who has a mistress, quickly will devour<br />
His patrimonial inheritance;<br />
So before him I place fat cuttle-fish<br />
Of every sort; and dishes too of fish<br />
Such as do haunt the rocks, all season'd highly<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 638]</span>

With every kind of clear transparent sauce.<br />
For such a man cares nought about his dinner,<br />
But all his thoughts are on his mistress fix'd.<br />
Then to philosophers I serve up ham,<br />
Or pettitoes; for all that crafty tribe<br />
Are wonderful performers at the table.<br />
Owls, eels, and spars I give the publicans,<br />
When they're in season, but at other times<br />
Some lentil salad. And all funeral feasts<br />
I make more splendid than the living ones.<br />
For old men's palates are not critical;<br />
At least not half so much as those of youths.<br />
And so I give them mustard, and I make them<br />
Sauces of pungent nature, which may rouse<br />
Their dormant sense, and make it snuff the air;<br />
And when I once behold a face, I know<br />
The dishes that its owner likes to eat.
</div>

<p>69. And the cook in the Thesmophorus of Dionysius, my revellers, (for
it is worth while to mention him also,) says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You have said these things with great severity,<br />
(And that's your usual kindness, by the Gods);<br />
You've said a cook should always beforehand<br />
Know who the guests may be for whom he now<br />
Is dressing dinner. For he should regard<br />
This single point&mdash;whom he has got to please<br />
While seasoning his sauces properly;<br />
And by this means he'll know the proper way<br />
And time to lay his table and to dress<br />
His meats and soups. But he who this neglects<br />
Is not a cook, though he may be a seasoner.<br />
But these are different arts, a wondrous space<br />
Separates the two. It is not every one<br />
That's called a general who commands an army,<br />
But he who can with prompt and versatile skill<br />
Avail himself of opportunities,<br />
And look about him, changing quick his plans,<br />
He is the general. He who can't do this<br />
Is only in command. And so with us.<br />
To roast some beef, to carve a joint with neatness,<br />
To boil up sauces, and to blow the fire,<br />
Is anybody's task; he who does this<br />
Is but a seasoner and broth-maker:<br />
A cook is quite another thing. His mind<br />
Must comprehend all facts and circumstances:<br />
Where is the place, and when the time of supper;<br />
Who are the guests, and who the entertainer;<br />
What fish he ought to buy, and when to buy it.<br />
*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * For all these things<br />
You'll have on almost every occasion;

But they're not always of the same importance,<br />
Nor do they always the same pleasure give.<br />
Archestratus has written on this art,<br />
And is by many people highly thought of,<br />
As having given us a useful treatise;<br />
But still there's much of which he's ignorant,<br />
And all his rules are really good for nothing,<br />
So do not mind or yield to all the rules<br />

For a more empty lot of maxims you<br />

Dost fear that I shall fail to lull your soul<br />

<p>70. And to all this &AElig;milianus makes answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
My friend, you've made a speech quite long enough<br />
In praising your fav'rite art of cookery;&mdash;
</div>

<p>as Hegesippus says in his Brethren. Do you then&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

But show me what you've got, and tell its name.
</div>

<p>And he rejoins&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You look down on me, since I am a cook.
</div>

<p>But perhaps&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What I have made by practising my art&mdash;
</div>

<p>according to the comic poet Demetrius, who, in his play entitled The
Areopagite, has spoken as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What I have made by practising my art<br />
Is more than any actor e'er has gain'd,&mdash;<br />
This smoky art of mine is quite a kingdom.<br />
I was a caper-pickler with Seleucus,<br />
And at the court of the Sicilian king,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 640]</span>

Agathocles, I was the very first<br />
To introduce the royal dish of lentils.<br />
My chief exploit I have not mention'd yet:<br />
There was a famine, and a man named Lachares<br />
Was giving an entertainment to his friends;<br />
Whom I recovered with some caper-sauce.
</div>

<p>Lachares made Minerva naked, who caused him no inconvenience; but I
will now strip you who are inconveniencing me, said &AElig;milianus, unless
you show me what you have got with you. And he said at last, rather
unwillingly, I call this dish the Dish of Roses. And it is prepared
in such a way, that you may not only have the ornament of a garland
on your head, but also in yourself, and so feast your whole body with
a luxurious banquet. Having pounded a quantity of the most fragrant
roses in a mortar, I put in the brains of birds and pigs boiled and
thoroughly cleansed of all the sinews, and also the yolks of eggs,
and with them oil, and pickle-juice, and pepper, and wine. And having
pounded all these things carefully together, I put them into a new
dish, applying a gentle and steady fire to them. And while saying this,
he uncovered the dish, and diffused such a sweet perfume over the whole
party, that one of the guests present said with great truth&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The winds perfumed the balmy gale convey<br />
Through heav'n, through earth, and all the aërial way;
</div>

<p>so excessive was the fragrance which was diffused from the roses.</p>

<p>71. After this, some roasted birds were brought round, and some lentils
and peas, saucepans and all, and other things of the same kind,
concerning which Ph&aelig;nias the Eresian writes thus, in his treatise on
Plants&mdash;"For every leguminous cultivated plant bearing seed, is sown
either for the sake of being boiled, such as the bean and the pea, (for
a sort of boiled soup is made of these vegetables,) or else for the
sake of extracting from them a farinaceous flour, as, for instance,
the aracus; or else to be cooked like lentils, as the aphace and the
common lentil; and some again are sown in order to serve as food for
fourfooted animals, as, for instance, the vetch for cattle, and the
aphace for sheep. But the vegetable called the pea is mentioned by
Eupolis, in his Golden Age." And Heliodorus, who wrote a description of
the whole world, in the first book of his treatise on the Acropolis,
said&mdash;"After the manner in which to boil wheat was discovered, the
ancients called it <ins title="Greek: pyanon">πύανον</ins>, but the people of
the present day name it <ins title="Greek: holopyron">ὁλόπυρον</ins>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 641]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CHAM&AElig;LEON.</div>

<p>Now, after this discussion had continued a long time, Democritus
said&mdash;But at least allow us to have a share of these lentils, or of
the saucepan itself, lest some of you get pelted with stones, like
Hegemon the Thasian. And Ulpian said,&mdash;What is the meaning of this
pelting (<ins title="Greek: ballêtys">βαλλητὺς</ins>) with stones? for I know that in my native
city, Eleusis, there is a festival celebrated which is called <ins title="Greek: ballêtys">βαλλητὺς</ins>,
concerning which I will not say a word, unless I get a
reward from each of you. But I, said Democritus, as I am not a person
who makes speeches by the hour for hire, like the Prodeipnus of Timon,
will tell you all I know about Hegemon.</p>

<p>72. Cham&aelig;leon of Pontus, in the sixth book of his treatise concerning
ancient Comedy, says&mdash;"Hegemon of Thasos, the man who wrote the
Parodies, was nicknamed The Lentil, and in one of his parodies he
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
While I revolved these counsels in my mind,<br />
Pallas Minerva, with her golden sceptre,<br />
Stood by my head, and touched me, and thus spake&mdash;<br />
O thou ill-treated Lentil, wretched man,<br />
Go to the contest: and I then took courage.
</div>

<p>And once he came into the theatre, exhibiting a comedy, having his robe
full of stones; and he, throwing the stones into the orchestra, caused
the spectators to wonder what he meant. And presently afterwards he
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
These now are stones, and let who chooses throw them;<br />
But Lentil's good alike at every season.
</div>

<p>But the man has an exceedingly high reputation for his parodies, and
was exceedingly celebrated for reciting his verses with great skill
and dramatic power; and on this account he was greatly admired by the
Athenians. And in his Battle of the Giants, he so greatly delighted
the Athenians, that they laughed to excess on that day; and though on
that very day the news of all the disasters which had befallen them
in Sicily had just arrived, still no one left the theatre, although
nearly every one had lost relations by that calamity; and so they hid
their faces and wept, but no one rose to depart, in order to avoid
being seen by the spectators from other cities to be grieved at the
disaster. But they remained listening to the performance, and that too,
though Hegemon himself, when he heard of it, had resolved to cease his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 642]</span>

recitation. But when the Athenians, being masters of the sea, brought
all the actions at law concerning the islands or the islanders into the
city, some one instituted a prosecution against Hegemon, and summoned
him to Athens to answer it. And he came in court, and brought with him
all the workmen of the theatre, and with them he appeared, entreating
Alcibiades to assist him. And Alcibiades bade him be of good cheer, and
ordered all the workmen to follow him; and so he came to the temple of
Cybele, where the trials of prosecutions were held; and then wetting
his finger with his mouth, he wiped out the indictment against Hegemon.
And though the clerk of the court and the magistrate were indignant at
this, they kept quiet for fear of Alcibiades, for which reason also the
man who had instituted the prosecution ran away."</p>

<p>73. This, O Ulpian, is what we mean by pelting (<ins title="Greek: ballêtys">βαλλητὺς</ins>), but you,
when you please, may tell us about the <ins title="Greek: ballêtys">βαλλητὺς</ins> at Eleusis. And Ulpian
replied,&mdash;But you have reminded me, my good friend Democritus, by
your mention of saucepans, that I have often wished to know what that
is which is called the saucepan of Telemachus, and who Telemachus was.
And Democritus said,—Timocles the comic poet, and he was also a writer
of tragedy, in his drama called Lethe, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And after this Telemachus did meet him,<br />
And with great cordiality embraced him,<br />
And said, "Now lend me, I do beg, the saucepans<br />
In which you boil'd your beans." And scarcely had<br />
He finish'd saying this, when he beheld<br />
At some small distance the renowned Philip,<br />
Son of Ch&aelig;rephilus, that mighty man,<br />
Whom he accosted with a friendly greeting,<br />
And then he bade him send some wicker baskets.
</div>

<p>But that this Telemachus was a citizen of the borough of Acharn&aelig;, the
same poet shows us in his Bacchus, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Telemachus th' Acharnian still is speaking,</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> How so, what does he do? I wish to know.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> He bears about with him a deadly dish.</span>
</div>

<p>And in his Icarians, a satyric drama, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">BEAN SOUP.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Sleep on the hardest bed; and then that Lion,<br />
Thudippus, did congeal us all with fear;<br />
Then hunger pinch'd us . . . . . .<br />
And so we went unto the fiery Dion.<br />
But even he had nought with which to help us;<br />
So running to the excellent Telemachus,<br />
The great Acharnian, I found a heap<br />
Of beans, and seized on some and ate them up.<br />
And when that ass Cephisodorus saw us,<br />
He by a most unseemly noise betray'd us.
</div>

<p>From this it is plain that Telemachus, being a person who was
constantly eating dishes of beans, was always celebrating the festival
Pyanepsia.</p>

<p>74. And bean soup is mentioned by Heniochus the comic writer, in his
play called the Wren, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I often, by the Gods I swear, consider</span><br />
In my own mind how far a fig surpasses<br />
A cardamum. But you assert that you<br />
Have held some conversation with this Pauson,<br />
And you request of me a difficult matter.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> But having many cares of divers aspects,</span><br />
Just tell me this, and it may prove amusing;<br />
Why does bean soup so greatly fill the stomach,<br />
And why do those who know this Pauson's habits<br />
Dislike the fire? For this great philosopher<br />
Is always occupied in eating beans.
</div>

<p>75. So after this conversation had gone on for some time, water for the
hands was brought round; and then again Ulpian asked whether the word
<ins title="Greek: chernibon">χέρνιβον</ins>, which we use in ordinary conversation, was used
by the ancients; and who had met with it; quoting that passage in the
Iliad&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring<br />
The purest water of the living spring,<br />
(Her ready hands the ewer (<ins title="Greek: chernibon">χέρνιβον</ins>) and basin held,)<br />
Then took the golden cup his queen had fill'd.
</div>

<p>But the Attic writers say <ins title="Greek: chernibion">χερνίβιον</ins>, as Lysias, for instance, in
his speech against Alcibiades, where he says, "With all his golden
wash-hand basins (<ins title="Greek: chernibiois">χερνιβιοις</ins>) and incense-burners;" but Eupolis uses
the word <ins title="Greek: cheironiptron">χειρόνιπτρον</ins>, in his Peoples&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And he who runs up first receives a basin (<ins title="Greek: cheironiptron">χειρόνιπτρον</ins>),<br />
But when a man is both a virtuous man<br />
And useful citizen, though he surpass<br />
In virtue all the rest, he gets no basin (<ins title="Greek: cheironiptron">χειρόνιπτρον</ins>).
</div>

<p>But Epicharmus, in his Ambassadors for a Sacred Purpose, uses the
word <ins title="Greek: cheironibon">χειρόνιβον</ins> in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 644]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
A harp, and tripods, chariots too, and tables<br />
Of brass Corinthian, and wash-hand basins (<ins title="Greek: cheironiba">χειρόνιβα</ins>),<br />
Cups for libations, brazen caldrons too.
</div>

<p>But it is more usual to say <ins title="Greek: kata cheiros hydôr">κατὰ χειρὸς ὕδωρ</ins> (water to be poured over
the hands), as Eupolis does say in his Golden Age, and Ameipsias in
his Sling, and Alcæus in his Sacred Wedding: and this is a very common
expression. But Philyllius, in his Auge, says <ins title="Greek: kata cheirôn">κατὰ χειρῶν</ins>, not <ins title="Greek: cheiros">χειρὸς</ins>,
in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And since the women all have dined well,<br />
'Tis time to take away the tables now,<br />
And wipe them, and then give each damsel water<br />
To wash her hands (<ins title="Greek: kata cheirôn">κατὰ χειρῶν</ins>), and perfumes to anoint them.
</div>

<p>And Menander, in his Pitcher, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And they having had water for their hands (<ins title="Greek: kata cheirôn labontes">κατὰ χειρῶν λαβόντες</ins>),<br />
Wait in a friendly manner.
</div>

<p>76. But Aristophanes the grammarian, in his Commentary on the Tablets
of Callimachus, laughs at those who do not know the difference between
the two expressions, <ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins> and<ins title="Greek: aponipsasthai"> ἀπονίψασθαι</ins>; for he says that
among the ancients the way in which people washed their hands before
breakfast and supper was called <ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins>, but what was done after
those meals was called <ins title="Greek: aponipsasthai">ἀπονίψασθαι</ins>. But the grammarian appears to
have taken this observation from the Attic writers, since Homer says,
somewhere or other&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Marshall'd in order due, to each a ewer<br />
Presents, to bathe his hands (<ins title="Greek: nipsasthai">νίψασθαι</ins>), a radiant ewer;<br />
Luxuriant then they feast.
</div>

<p>And somewhere else he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The golden ewer a maid obsequious brings,<br />
Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs,<br />
With copious water the bright vase supplies,<br />
A silver laver of capacious size;<br />
They wash (<ins title="Greek: hydôr epi cheiras echeuan">ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν</ins>). The tables in fair order spread,<br />
They heap the glittering canisters with bread.
</div>

<p>And Sophron, in his Female Actresses, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O hard-work'd Cæcoa, give us water for our hands (<ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins>),<br />
And then prepare the table for our food.
</div>

<p>And among both the tragic and comic writers the word <ins title="Greek: cherniba">χερνίβα</ins>
is read with an acute accent on the penultima. By Euripides, in his
Hercules&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Which great Alcmena's son might in the basin (<ins title="Greek: cherniba">χερνίβα</ins>) dip.
</div>

<p>And also by Eupolis, in his Goats&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Here make an end of your lustration (<ins title="Greek: cherniba">χερνίβα</ins>).
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 645]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">SOAP.</div>

<p>And <ins title="Greek: chernips">χέρνιψ</ins> means the water into which they used to dip a firebrand
which they took from the altar on which they were offering the
sacrifice, and then sprinkling the bystanders with it, they purified
them. But the accusative <ins title="Greek: cherniba">χερνιβα</ins> ought to be written with an acute
accent on the antepenultima; for all compound words like that,
ending in <ins title="Greek: ps">ψ</ins>, derived from the perfect passive, preserve the vowel
of the penultima of that perfect tense. And if the perfect ends its
penultimate syllable with a double <ins title="Greek: mm">μμ</ins>, then the derivative has a grave
on the ultima, as <ins title="Greek: leleimmai aigilips">λέλειμμαι αἰγίλιψ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: tetrimmai oikotrips">τέτριμμαι οἰκότριψ</ins>,
<ins title="Greek: keklemmai bookleps">κέκλεμμαι βοόκλεψ</ins> (a word found in Sophocles and applied to Mercury),
<ins title="Greek: beblemmai katôbleps">βέβλεμμαι κατώβλεψ</ins> (a word found in Archelaus of the Chersonese, in his poem on
Things of a Peculiar Nature: and in the oblique cases such words keep
the accent on the same syllable). And Aristophanes, in his Heroes, has
used the word <ins title="Greek: chernibion">χερνίβιον</ins>.</p>

<p>77. And for washing the hands they also used something which they
called <ins title="Greek: smêma">σμῆμα</ins>, or soap, for the sake of getting off the dirt;
as Antiphanes mentions in his Corycus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> But while I'm listening to your discourse,</span><br />
Bid some one bring me water for my hands.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Let some one here bring water and some <ins title="Greek: smêma">σμῆμα</ins>.</span>
</div>

<p>And besides this they used to anoint their hands with perfumes,
despising the crumbs of bread on which men at banquets used to wipe
their hands, and which the Laced&aelig;monians called <ins title="Greek: kynades">κυνάδες</ins>,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
as Polemo mentions in his Letter on Mean Appellations. But concerning
the custom of anointing the hands with perfumes, Epigenes or Antiphanes
(whichever was the author of the play called the Disappearance of
Money) speaks as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then you'll walk about, and, in the fashion,<br />
Will take some scented earth, and wash your hands.
</div>

<p>And Philoxenus, in his play entitled the Banquet, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the slaves brought water for the hands (<ins title="Greek: niptra kata cheirôn">νίπτρα κατὰ χειρῶν</ins>),<br />
And soap (<ins title="Greek: smêma">σμῆμα</ins>) well mix'd with oily juice of lilies,<br />
And poured o'er the hands as much warm water<br />
As the guests wish'd. And then they gave them towels<br />
Of finest linen, beautifully wrought,<br />
And fragrant ointments of ambrosial smell,<br />
And garlands of the flow'ring violet.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 646]</span></p>

<p>And Dromo, in his Female Harp-player, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then, as soon as we had breakfasted,<br />
One handmaid took away the empty tables,<br />
Another brought us water for our hands;<br />
We wash'd, and took our lily wreaths again,<br />
And crown'd our heads with garlands.
</div>

<p>78. But they called the water in which they washed either their hands
or their feet equally <ins title="Greek: aponiptron">απονιπτρον</ins>, Aristophanes says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Like those who empty slops(<ins title="Greek: aponiptron">απονιπτρον</ins>) at eventide.
</div>

<p>And they used the word <ins title="Greek: lekanê">λεκάνη</ins>, or basin, in the same way as
they used <ins title="Greek: cheironiptron">χειρόνιπτρον</ins> (a wash-hand basin); but the word
<ins title="Greek: aponimma">ἀπόνιμμα</ins> is used in a peculiar sense by the Attic writers only
for the water used to do honour to the dead, and for purifying men who
have incurred some religious pollution. As also Clidemus tells us, in
his book entitled Exegeticus; for he, having mentioned the subject of
Offerings to the Dead, writes as follows:&mdash;"Dig a trench to the west
of the tomb. Then look along the side of the trench towards the west.
Then pour down water, saying these words,&mdash;'I pour this as a purifying
water for you to whom it is right to pour it, and who have a right to
expect it.' Then after that pour perfume." And Dorotheus gives the
same instructions; saying, that among the hereditary national customs
of the people of Thyatira, these things are written concerning the
purification of suppliants,&mdash;"Then having washed your hands yourself,
and when all the rest of those who have joined in disembowelling the
victim have washed theirs, take water and purify yourselves, and wash
off all the blood from him who is to be purified: and afterwards stir
the purifactory water, and pour it into the same place."</p>

<p>79. But the cloth of unbleached linen with which they used to wipe
their hands was called <ins title="Greek: cheiromaktron">χειρόμακτρον</ins>, which also, in some verses
which have been already quoted, by Philoxenus of Cythera, was called
<ins title="Greek: ektrimma">ἔκτριμμα</ins>. Aristophanes, in his Cook's Frying, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Bring quickly, slave, some water for the hands (<ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρος</ins>),<br />
And bring at the same time a towel (<ins title="Greek: cheiromaktron">χειρόμακτρον</ins>) too.
</div>

<p>(And we may remark here, that in this passage he uses the expression
<ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins> with reference to washing the hands after eating;
not, as Aristophanes the grammarian says, that</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">TOWELS.</div>

<p>the Athenians used the expression <ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins> before eating, but the word
<ins title="Greek: nipsasthai">νίψασθαι</ins> after eating.) Sophocles, in his &OElig;nomaus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Shaved in the Scythian manner, while his hair<br />
Served for a towel, and to wipe his hands in.
</div>

<p>And Herodotus, in the second book of his History, speaks in a similar
manner. But Xenophon, in the first book of his Cyropædia, writes—"But
when you have touched any one of these things, you immediately wipe
your hands in a towel, as if you were greatly annoyed at their having
been polluted in such a manner." And Polemo, in the sixth book of
his books addressed to Antigonus and Adæus, speaks of the difference
between the two expressions <ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins> and <ins title="Greek: nipsasthai">νίψασθαι</ins>. And Demonicus, in his
Achelonius, uses the expression <ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins>, of water used before a
meal, in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But each made haste, as being about to dine<br />
With one who'd always a good appetite,<br />
And who had also but B&oelig;otian manners.<br />
And so they all neglected washing their hands (<ins title="Greek: kata cheiros">κατὰ χειρὸς</ins>),<br />
Because they could do that when they had dined.
</div>

<p>And Cratinus also mentions towels, which he calls <ins title="Greek: ômolinon">ὠμόλινον</ins>, in
his Archilochi,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
With her hair cover'd with a linen towel,<br />
Token of slovenly neglect.
</div>

<p>And Sappho, in the fifth book of her Melodies addressed to Venus, when
she says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And purple towels o'er your knees I'll throw,<br />
And do not you despise my precious gifts<br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>speaks of these towels as a covering for the head; as Hecat&aelig;us shows,
or whoever else it was who wrote those Descriptions of the World in the
book entitled Asia,&mdash;"And the women wear towels (<ins title="Greek: cheiromaktra">χειρόμακτρα</ins>)
on their heads." And Herodotus, in his second book, says, "And after
this they said that this king descended down alive into the lower
regions, which the Greeks call <ins title="Greek: Haidês">αἵδης</ins>, and that there he
played at dice with Ceres, and that sometimes he won and sometimes he
lost; and that after that he returned to earth with a gold-embroidered
towel, which he had received as a present from her."</p>

<p>80. And Hellanicus, in his Histories, says that the name of the boy
who, when he had given Hercules water to wash his hands, and poured
it over his hands from the basin, was afterwards slain by Hercules
with a blow of his fist, (on which account Hercules left Calydon,) was
Archias; but in the second book of the Phoronis he calls him Cherias:
but Herodorus, in the seventeenth book of his account of the Exploits
of Hercules, calls him Eunomus. And Hercules also, without intending
it, killed Cyathus, the son of Pyles and brother of Antimachus, who was
acting as his cupbearer, as Nicander relates in the second book of his
History of &OElig;ta; to whom also he says that a temple was dedicated by
Hercules in the Proschium, which to this day is called the Temple of
the Cupbearer.</p>

<p>But we will stop this conversation at this point, and begin the next
book with an account of the voracity of Hercules.</p>

<p>These, my good friend Timocrates, are the words of Astydamas the
tragedian, in his satyric drama of Hercules. Come, let us now proceed
to mention what is consistent with what we have said before, to show
how great an eater Hercules was. And this is a point in his character
mentioned by nearly all poets and historians. Epicharmus, in his
Busiris, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For if you were to see him eat, you would<br />
Be frighten'd e'en to death; his jaws do creak,<br />
His throat with long deep-sounding thunder rolls,<br />
His large teeth rattle, and his dog-teeth crash,<br />
His nostrils hiss, his ears with hunger tremble.
</div>

<p>And Ion, in his Omphale, having mentioned his voracity, adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then, excited by th' applause, he rose<br />
And swallow'd all the logs and burning coals.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 649]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ULYSSES.</div>

<p>But Ion borrowed all this from Pindar, who said<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>

<p>And they say that he was a man of such excessive voracity, that they
gave him the cormorant, amongst birds which should be sacred to him,
which is called the ox-eater, on account of its voracity.</p>

<p>2. And Hercules is represented as having entered into a contest
with Lepreus in respect of their mutual powers of eating, Lepreus
having been the challenger: however, Hercules gained the victory. But
Zenodotus, in the second book of his Epitomes, says that Lepreus was
the son of Caucon, who was the son of Neptune and Astydamia; and that
he ordered Hercules to be thrown into prison, when he demanded of
Augeas the reward which was due to him for his labours. But Hercules,
when he had completed his labours, came to the house of Caucon, and at
the entreaty of Astydamia, he became reconciled to Lepreus. And after
this Lepreus contended with Hercules in throwing the quoit, and in
drawing water, and also as to which would eat a bull with the greatest
rapidity; and in all these things he was defeated. And after that he
armed himself, and challenged Hercules to single combat, and was slain
in the battle. But Matris, in his panegyric on Hercules, says, that
Hercules was also challenged by Lepreus to a contest as to who could
drink most, and that Lepreus was again defeated. And the Chian orator,
Caucalus, the brother of Theopompus the historian, relates the same
story in his panegyric on Hercules.</p>

<p>3. Homer, too, represents Ulysses as a great eater, and a very
voracious man, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What histories of toil I could declare,<br />
But still long-wearied nature wants repair.<br />
Spent with fatigue and shrunk with pining fast,<br />
My craving bowels still require repast;<br />
Howe'er the noble suffering mind may grieve<br />
Its load of anguish, and disdain to live,<br />
Necessity demands our daily bread;<br />
Hunger is insolent and will be fed.
</div>

<p>For in these lines his gluttony appears prodigious, when it induces him
on so unseasonable an occasion to utter apophthegms about his stomach.
For he ought, if he had been ever so hungry, to have endured it, or at
all events to have been moderate in his food. But this last passage

<div class="blockindent">
For all my mind is overwhelm'd with care,<br />
But hunger is the worst of griefs to bear;<br />
Still does my stomach bid me eat and drink,<br />
Lest on my sorrows I too deeply think.<br />
Food makes me all my sufferings forget,<br />
And fear not those which may surround me yet.
</div>

<p>For even the notorious Sardanapalus would hardly have ventured to give
utterance to such sentiments as those. Moreover, when Ulysses was an
old man&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Voraciously he endless dishes ate,<br />
And quaff'd unceasing cups of wine. . . .
</div>

<p>4. But Theagenes of Thasos, the athlete, ate a bull single-handed, as
Posidippus tells us in his Epigrams.</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And as I'd undertaken, I did eat<br />
A Thracian bull. My own poor native land<br />
Of Thasos could not have purvey'd a meal<br />
Sufficient for the hunger of Theagenes.<br />
I ate all I could get, then ask'd for more.<br />
And, therefore, here you see, I stand in brass,<br />
Holding my right hand forth; put something in it.

<p>And Milo of Crotona, as Theodorus of Hierapolis tells us in his book
upon Games, ate twenty min&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> weight of meat, and an equal quantity of
bread, and drank three choes<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of wine. And once at Olympia he took
a four year old bull on his shoulders, and carried it all round the
course, and after that he killed it and cut it up, and ate it all up
by himself in one day. And Titormus the &AElig;tolian had a contest with him
as to which could eat an ox with the greatest speed, as Alexander the
&AElig;tolian relates. But Phylarchus, in the third book of his Histories,
says that Milo, while lying down before the altar of Jupiter, ate a
bull, on which account Dorieus the poet made the following epigram on
him:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 651]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
Milo could lift enormous weights from earth,<br />
<span class="linespace1">A heifer four years old, at Jove's high feast,</span><br />
And on his shoulders the huge beast he bore,<br />
<span class="linespace1">As it had been a young and little lamb,</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">But he did still a greater feat than this,</span><br />

<p>But Astydamas the Milesian, having gained the victory at Olympia three
times in the pancratium, being once invited to supper by Ariobarzanes
the Persian, when he had come, offered to eat everything that had been
prepared for the whole party, and did eat it. And when, Theodorus
relates, the Persian entreated him to do something suitable to his
enormous strength, he broke off a large brazen ornament in the shape of
a lentil from the couch and crushed it in his hand. And when he died,
and when his body was burnt, one urn would not contain his bones, and
scarcely two could do so. And they say that the dinner which he ate by
himself at Ariobarzanes's table had been prepared for nine persons.</p>

<p>5. And there is nothing unnatural in such men as those being very
voracious; for all the men who practise athletic exercises, learn with
these gymnastic exercises also to eat a great deal. On which account
Euripides says, in the first edition of his Autolycus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For when there are ten thousand ills in Greece,<br />
There's none that's worse than the whole race of athletes.<br />
For, first of all, they learn not to live well,<br />
Nor could they do so; for could any man<br />
Being a slave to his own jaws and appetite<br />
Acquire wealth beyond his father's riches?<br />
How could a man like that increase his substance?<br />
Nor yet can they put up with poverty,<br />
Or e'er accommodate themselves to fortune;<br />
And so being unaccustom'd to good habits,<br />
They quickly fall into severe distress.&mdash;<br />
In youth they walk about in fine attire,<br />
And think themselves a credit to the city;<br />
But when old age in all its bitterness<br />
O'ertakes their steps, they roam about the streets,<br />
Like ragged cloaks whose nap is all worn off.<br />
And much I blame the present fashions, too,<br />
Which now in Greece prevail; where many a feast<br />
Is made to pay great honour to such men,<br />
And to show false respect to vain amusements.<br />
For though a man may wrestle well, or run,<br />
Or throw a quoit, or strike a heavy blow,<br />
Still where's the good his country can expect<br />
From all his victories and crowns and prizes?<br />
Will they fight with their country's enemies<br />
With quoit in hand? Or will their speed assist<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 652]</span>

To make the hostile bands retreat before them?<br />
When men stand face to face with th' hostile sword<br />
They think no more of all these fooleries.<br />
'Twere better to adorn good men and wise<br />
With these victorious wreaths; they are the due<br />
Of those who govern states with wisdom sound,<br />
And practise justice, faith, and temperance;<br />
Who by their prudent language ward off evils,<br />
Banishing wars and factions. These are the men,<br />
Who're not alone a grace and ornament<br />
To their own land, but to the whole of Greece.
</div>

<p>6. Now Euripides took all this from the Elegies of Xenophanes the
Colophonian, who has spoken in this way&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But if a man, in speed of foot victorious,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Or in the contests of the pentathlum,</span><br />
Where is the sacred grove of Jupiter,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Near to the sacred streamlets of Olympia;</span><br />
Or as a wrestler, or exchanging blows<br />
<span class="linespace1">And painful struggles as a hardy boxer,</span><br />
Or in the terrible pancratium,<br />
<span class="linespace1">He surely is a noble citizen,</span><br />
And well he does deserve the honours due<br />

Which shall become an heirloom to his children.<br />
<span class="linespace1">And such shall be his honours, even if</span><br />
He wins by horses, not by his own strength.<br />
<span class="linespace1">And still I think he does not equal me;</span><br />
For wisdom far exceeds in real value<br />
<span class="linespace1">The bodily strength of man, or horses' speed;</span><br />
But the mob judges of such things at random;<br />
<span class="linespace1">Though 'tis not right to prefer strength to sense:</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">Which is the most important of all contests&mdash;</span><br />
Still for all this his city will enjoy<br />
<span class="linespace1">No better laws through his great strength or speed;</span><br />
And 'tis small cause for any lasting joy,<br />

A prize on Pisa's banks; for such achievements<br />
<span class="linespace1">Fill not the country's granaries with corn.</span>

<p>And Xenophanes contends at great length, and with great earnestness and
variety of argument, in favour of the superior advantage of his own
wisdom, running down athletic exercises as useless and unprofitable.
And Ach&aelig;us the Eretrian, speaking of the good constitution of the
athletes, says&mdash;</p>

<p>7. But Heraclitus, in his Entertainer of Strangers, says that there was
a woman named Helena, who ate more than any other woman ever did. And
Posidippus, in his Epigrams, says that Phuromachus was a great eater,
on whom he wrote this epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This lowly ditch now holds Phuromachus,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Who used to swallow everything he saw,</span><br />

For from the gay Len&aelig;an games he came,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Descending humbly to Calliope.</span>
</div>

<p>But Amarantus of Alexandria, in his treatise on the Stage, says that
Herodorus, the Megarian trumpeter, was a man three cubits and a half
in height; and that he had great strength in his chest, and that he
could eat six ch&oelig;nixes<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> of bread, and twenty litr&aelig; of meat, of
whatever sort was provided for him, and that he could drink two choes
of wine; and that he could play on two trumpets at once; and that it
was his habit to sleep on only a lion's skin, and when playing on the
trumpet he made a vast noise. Accordingly, when Demetrius, the son of
Antigonus, was besieging Argos, and when his troops could not bring
the helepolis against the walls on account of its weight, he, giving
the signal with his two trumpets at once, by the great volume of sound
which he poured forth, instigated the soldiers to move forward the
engine with great zeal and earnestness; and he gained the prize in
all the games ten times; and he used to eat sitting down, as Nestor
tells us in his Theatrical Reminiscences. And there was a woman,
too, who played on the trumpet, whose name was Aglais, the daughter

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 654]</span>

of Megacles, who, in the first great procession which took place in
Alexandria, played a processional piece of music; having a head-dress
of false hair on, and a crest upon her head, as Posidippus proves by
his epigrams on her. And she, too, could eat twelve litr&aelig; of meat and
four ch&oelig;nixes of bread, and drink a choeus of wine, at one sitting.</p>

<p>8. There was, besides, a man of the name of Lityerses, a bastard son
of Midas, the king of Cel&aelig;n&aelig; in Phrygia, a man of a savage and fierce
aspect, and an enormous glutton; and he is mentioned by Sositheus the
tragic poet, in his play called Daphnis or Lityersa; where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He'll eat three asses' panniers, freight and all,<br />
Three times in one brief day; and what he calls<br />
A measure of wine is a ten-amphor&aelig; cask;<br />
And this he drinks all at a single draught.
</div>

<p>And the man mentioned by Pherecrates, or Strattis, whichever was the
author of the play called The Good Men, was much such another; the
author says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I scarcely in one day, unless I'm forced,</span><br />

<p>And Xanthus, in his Account of Lydia, says that Cambles, who was
the king of the Lydians, was a great eater and drinker, and also an
exceeding epicure; and accordingly, that he one night cut up his own
wife into joints and ate her; and then, in the morning, finding the
hand of his wife still sticking in his mouth, he slew himself, as
his act began to get notorious. And we have already mentioned Thys,
the king of the Paphlagonians, saying that he too was a man of vast
appetite, quoting Theopompus, who speaks of him in the thirty-fifth
book of his History; and Archilochus, in his Tetrameters, has accused
Charilas of the same fault, as the comic poets have attacked Cleonymus
and Pisander. And Ph&oelig;nicides mentions Ch&aelig;rippus in his Phylarchus in
the following terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And next to them I place Ch&aelig;rippus third;<br />
He, as you know, will without ceasing eat<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">VORACITY OF MITHRIDATES.</div>

<p>9. And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the hundred and third book of his
History, says that Mithridates, the king of Pontus, once proposed
a contest in great eating and great drinking (and the prize was a
talent of silver), and that he himself gained the victory in both; but
he yielded the prize to the man who was judged to be second to him,
namely, Calomodrys, the athlete of Cyzicus. And Timocreon the Rhodian,
a poet, and an athlete who had gained the victory in the pentathlum,
ate and drank a great deal, as the epigram on his tomb shows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Much did I eat, much did I drink, and much<br />
Did I abuse all men; now here I lie;&mdash;<br />
My name Timocreon, my country Rhodes.
</div>

<p>And Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, in one his Prefaces, says that Timocreon
came to the great king of Persia, and being entertained by him, did
eat an immense quantity of food; and when the king asked him, What he
would do on the strength of it? he said that he would beat a great many
Persians; and the next day, having vanquished a great many, one after
another, taking them one by one, after this, he beat the air with his
hands; and when they asked him what he wanted, he said that he had
all those blows left in him if any one was inclined to come on. And
Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says, that Cantibaris the
Persian, whenever his jaws were weary with eating, had his slaves to
pour food into his mouth, which he kept open as if they were pouring
it into an empty vessel. But Hellanicus, in the first book of his
Deucalionea, says that Erysichthon, the son of Myrmidon, being a man
perfectly insatiable in respect of food, was called &AElig;thon. And Polemo,
in the first book of his Treatise addressed to Tim&aelig;us, says that among
the Sicilians there was a temple consecrated to gluttony, and an image
of Ceres Sito;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> near which, also, there was a statue of
Himalis,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
as there is at Delphi one of Hermuchus,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and as at Scolum, in
Boeotia, there are statues of Megalartus<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and Megalomazus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 656]</span></p>

<p>10. And Alcman the poet records himself to have been a great eater, in
his third book of Odes, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And presently I will bestow<br />
On you a large round dish well fill'd;<br />
And even now 'tis on the fire,<br />
Full of pulse-broth, which e'en the glutton<br />
Alcman would like to feast on warm,<br />
After the wintry solstice sets in;<br />
For he for dainties does not care,<br />
But loves the common people's dishes,<br />
As long as they are full enough.
</div>

<p>And in his fifth book he also displays his love of eating, speaking
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
God has bestow'd on man three various seasons,<br />
The summer, and the winter, and the autumn;<br />
And a fourth too, the spring, when men can dance,<br />
But scarce are able to get much to eat.
</div>

<p>And Anaxilas the comic poet, speaking in his play called Chrysochous of
a man named Ctesias, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You now have nearly all things, save the art<br />
Of Ctesias himself; for wise men say,<br />
That he does recognise nought but the beginning<br />
Of a rich banquet, and denies the end.
</div>

<p>And in his Rich Men he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Others may also burst when fed too well</span><br />
Not Ctesias alone.&mdash;<br />
<span class="linespace6_75"><i>B.</i> What should hinder it?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> For he, as wise men say, loves the beginning</span><br />
Of any feast, but ne'er can make an end of it.
</div>

<p>And in his play called The Graces he includes a man called Cranaus in
his list of great eaters; saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Men do not come and ask at random now,<br />
Does Cranaus eat less than Ctesias?<br />
Or do they both keep constantly devouring?
</div>

<p>And Philet&aelig;rus, in his Atalante, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If it were needful, I could run more stadia<br />
Than e'er were run by Sotades; I surpass<br />
E'en Taureas himself in these my labours;<br />

<p>And Anaxippus, in his Thunderbolt, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And in these lines the comic poet shows that it was from this man that
he had given his play the title of The Thunderbolt. And Theophilus, in
his Epidaurus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There was a Mantinean centurion,<br />
Atrestides his name; who of all men<br />

</div>

<p>11. And whole nations also have been ridiculed by the comic poets for
their gluttony; as the B&oelig;otians, for instance. Accordingly, Eubulus
says, in his Antiopa&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We are courageous men to toil and eat,<br />
And to endure sharp pain; the Attic race<br />
Is quick and eloquent, and they eat little;<br />
But the B&oelig;otians eat enormously.
</div>

<p>And in his Europa he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Go now and build up the B&oelig;otian city,<br />
Where the men eat all day and never tire.
</div>

<p>And in his Ionian he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He is so thorough a B&oelig;otian<br />
In all his manners, that, like them, 'tis said<br />
He's never tired nor content with eating.
</div>

<p>And in his Cercopes he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And after that I came to Thebes, where men<br />
Spend the whole night in feasts and revelry;<br />
And each man has a privy at his doors,<br />
Which is a great boon to an o'er-fed man;<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 658]</span>

For men who have got a long way to go,<br />
And who eat much and bite their weary lips,<br />
Are some of the most ludicrous of sights.
</div>

<p>And in his Mysians he represents some one as making the following
speech to Hercules&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You leaving, as you say, the Theban plain,<br />
Where valiant men sit eating all the day,<br />
Being all throat, and close beside the privy.
</div>

<p>Diphilus, in his B&oelig;otian, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
That man can eat, beginning before dawn,<br />
Or come again and eat till the following day.
</div>

<p>Mnesimachus, in his Busiris, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
. . . . . . . For I am a B&oelig;otian,<br />
Who do not eat much else, except these things.
</div>

<p>Alexis, in his Trophonius, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now that you may not be found out thus,<br />
And spoken of as men of Boeotia,<br />
By those whose wont it is to run you down,<br />
As men unequall'd in creating noise,<br />
And knowing nothing else save how to eat<br />
And drink unceasingly the whole night long;<br />
Strip yourselves quick, and all prepare for action.
</div>

<p>And Ach&aelig;us, in his Contests, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Are you now speaking to the spectators here,</span><br />
Or to the body of competitors?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> To those who eat much, as men training do.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Whence do the strangers come from?</span><br />
<span class="linespace14_25"><i>B.</i> They're B&oelig;otians.</span>
</div>

<p>And very likely it is because of all this that Eratosthenes, in his
Epistles, says, that Pempelus, when he was asked, "What sort of people
the B&oelig;otians appeared to him?" answered, "That they only spoke just as
vessels might be expected to speak, if they had a voice, of how much
each of them could hold." And Polybius of Megalopolis, in the twentieth
book of his Histories, says that "the B&oelig;otians, having gained great
glory at the battle of Leuctra, after that relaxed their courage
again, and turned to feasting and drunkenness, and to making parties
for eating among friends; and many of them, even of those who had
children, spent the greater part of their substance on their feasts; so
that there were a great number of B&oelig;otians who had more invitations
to supper than there were days in the month. On which account the
Megarians, hating such a system as that, abandoned their alliance, and
joined themselves to the Ach&aelig;ans.</p>

<div class="sidenote-left">VORACITY OF THE TEMPERANCE.</div>

<p>12. The people of Pharsalus also are ridiculed by the comic poets as

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Has any man of the Pharsalians come,</span><br />

<span class="linespace10_25"><i>A.</i> So much the better;</span><br />
Perhaps they have all gone somewhere else to eat<br />
Some city of Achaïa ready roasted.
</div>

<p>And that it was a general imputation on all the Thessalians, that they
were great eaters, Crates tells us in his Lamia, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace1">Great words three cubits long,</span><br />
Cut into huge Thessalian slices thus:&mdash;
</div>

<p>and he by this alludes to the Thessalians as cutting their meat into
overgrown pieces. And Philet&aelig;rus, in his Lampbearers, says also&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And a huge piece of pork, enough to break<br />
One's arm, cut in the coarse Thessalian fashion.
</div>

<p>They used to speak also of a Thessalian mouthful, as something
enormous. Hermippus says in his Fates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But Jupiter, considering nought of this,<br />
Wink'd, and made up a huge Thessalian mouthful.

<p>And such great bits of meat Aristophanes, in his Men Frying, calls
Capanic, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace10">What is all this</span><br />
To the great Lydian and Thessalian banquets?
</div>

<p>And presently he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
More splendid (<ins title="Greek: kapanikôtera">καπανικώτερα</ins>) far than the Thessalian;
</div>

<p>meaning big enough to load a wagon. For the Thessalians use the word
<ins title="Greek: kapanê">καπάνη</ins> as equivalent to <ins title="Greek: apênê">ἀπήνη</ins>. Xenarchus, in his
Scythians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> They kept to seven Capan&aelig; for the games</span><br />

<p>13. And Hecat&aelig;us says that the Egyptians were great bread-eaters,
eating loaves of rye, called <ins title="Greek: kyllêsties">κυλλήστιες</ins>, and bruising barley

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 660]</span>

to extract a drink from it; and on this account Alexis, in his treatise
on Contentment, says that Bocchoris and his father Neochabis were
contented with a moderate quantity of food; as Lycon of Iasus relates
in his treatise on Pythagoras. But he did not abstain from animal food,
as Aristoxenus tells us; and Apollodorus the Arithmetician says, that
he even sacrificed a hecatomb when he found out that in a right-angled
triangle, the square of the side subtending the right angle is equal to
the squares of the two sides containing it&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When the illustrious Pythagoras<br />
Discover'd that renowned problem which<br />
He celebrated with a hecatomb.
</div>

<p>But Pythagoras was a very sparing drinker, and lived in a most frugal
manner, so that he often contented himself with honey by itself. And
nearly the same thing is told us of Aristides, and of Epaminondas, and
of Phocion, and of Phormio, the generals. But Manius Curius, the Roman
general, lived on turnips all his life; and once, when the Sabines
sent him a large sum of gold, he said he had no need of gold while he
ate such food as that. And this story is recorded by Megacles in his
treatise on Illustrious Men.</p>

<p>14. And there are many people who approve of moderate meals, as Alexis
tells us in his Woman in Love&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But I am content with what is necessary,<br />
And hate superfluous things; for in excess<br />
There is not pleasure, but extravagance.
</div>

<p>And in his Liar he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I hate excess; for those who practise it<br />
Have only more expense, but not more pleasure.
</div>

<p>And in his Foster Brothers he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
How sweet all kinds of moderation are!<br />
I now am going away, not empty, but<br />
In a most comfortable state,&mdash;for wise<br />
Mnesitheus tells us that 'tis always right<br />
T' avoid extravagance in everything.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 661]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MENEDEMUS.</div>

<p>And Ariston the philosopher, in the second book of his Amatory
Similitudes, says that Polemo, the Academic philosopher, used to exhort
those who were going to a supper, to consider how they might make their
party pleasant, not only for the present evening, but also for the
morrow. And Timotheus, the son of Conon, being once taken by Plato from
a very sumptuous and princely entertainment to one held at the Academy,
and being there feasted in a simple and scholar-like manner, said
that those who supped with Plato would be well the next day also. But
Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that on the next day Timotheus,
meeting with Plato, said, "You, O Plato, sup well, more with reference
to the next day than to the present one!" But Pyrrho the Elean, when
on one occasion one of his acquaintances received him with a very
sumptuous entertainment, as he himself relates, said, "I will for the
future not come to you if you receive me in this manner; that I may
avoid being grieved by seeing you go to a great expense for which there
is no necessity, and that you, too, may not come to distress by being
overwhelmed by such expenses; for it is much better for us to delight
one another by our mutual companionship and conversation, than by the
great variety of dishes which we set before one another, of which our
servants consume the greater part."</p>

<p>15. But Antigonus of Carystus, in his Life of Menedemus, relating the
way in which the banquets of that philosopher are managed, says, that
he used to dine with one or two companions at most; and that all the
rest of his guests used to come after they had supped. For in fact,
Menedemus's supper and dinner were only one meal, and after that was
over they called in all who chose to come; and if any of them, as would
be the case, came before the time, they would walk up and down before
the doors, and inquire of the servants who came out what was being now
served up, and how far on the dinner had proceeded. And if they heard
that it was only the vegetables or the cured fish that was being served
up, they went away; but if they were told that the meat was put on the
table, then they went into the room which had been prepared for that
purpose. And in the summer a rush mat was spread over each couch, and
in the winter a fleece. But every one was expected to bring his own
pillow; and the cup, which was brought round to each person, did not
hold more than one cotyla. And the dessert was lupins or beans as a
general rule; but sometimes some fruits, such as were in season, were
brought in; in summer, pears or pomegranates; and in spring, pulse; and
in winter, figs. And we have a witness as to these things, Lycophron
the Chalcidian, who wrote a satyric drama entitled Menedemus, in which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 662]</span>

Silenus says to the satyrs&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O cursed sons of a most excellent father,<br />
I, as you see, have quite a fancy for you:<br />
For, by the gods I swear, that not in Caria,<br />
Nor in fair Rhodes, nor royal Lydia,<br />
Have I e'er eaten so superb a supper;<br />
Phoebus Apollo! what a feast it was.
</div>

<p>And a little further on, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the boy brought us round a scanty cup<br />
Of wine that might be worth five pence a bottle&mdash;<br />
Awfully flat; and then that cursed thing,<br />
That hang-dog lupin, danced upon the board,<br />
A fitting meal for parasites and beggars.
</div>

<p>And presently afterwards, he says that philosophical disquisitions were
carried on during the entertainment&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace5">And for dessert,</span><br />
We had some learned conversation.
</div>

<p>It is also related that those who met in this way very often kept on
conversing to such a time that "the bird which calls the morn still
caught them talking, and they were not yet satisfied."</p>

<p>16. But Arcesilaus, when giving a supper to some people, when the bread
fell short, and his slave made him a sign that there were no loaves
left, burst out laughing, and clapped his hands; and said, "What a
feast we have here, my friends! We forgot to buy loaves enough; run
now, my boy:"&mdash;and this he said, laughing; and all the guests who were
present burst out laughing, and great amusement and entertainment were
excited, so that the very want of bread was a great seasoning to the
feast. And at another time, Arcesilaus ordered Apelles, one of his
friends, to strain some wine; and when he, not being used to doing so,
shook some of the wine and spilt some, so that the wine appeared much
thicker than usual, he laughed, and said, "But I told a man to strain
the wine who has never seen anything good any more than I myself have;
so do you now get up, Aridices; and do you go away and tap the casks
that are outside." And this good-humour of his so pleased and excited
the mirth of those present, that they were all filled with joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 663]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PRAISE OF TEMPERANCE.</div>

<p>17. But those of the present day who give entertainments, especially
the inhabitants of the beautiful Alexandria, cry out,
and make a noise, and curse the cupbearer, the steward, and cook; and
the slaves are all crying, being beaten with fists and driven about in
every direction. And not only do the guests who are invited sup with
great discomfort and annoyance, but even if there is any sacrifice
going on, the god himself would veil his face and go away, leaving not
only the house, but even the entire city, in which such things take
place. For it is absurd for a man, proclaiming that people should all
confine themselves to words of good omen, to curse his wife and his
children; and such a man as that would say to the guests&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now then let us hasten to the feast,<br />
That we may plan the movements of the war;&mdash;
</div>

<p>for such a man's house&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace5">Is redolent of frankincense,</span><br />
And p&aelig;ans too, and groans at the same time.
</div>

<p>Now, when all this had been said, one of the guests who were present
said,&mdash;We ought, then, when we consider these things, to guard against
indulging our appetites too much;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For a frugal supper breeds no drunkenness,
</div>

<p>as Amphis says, in his Pan: nor does it produce insolence or insulting
conduct; as Alexis testifies in his Ulysses Weaving, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For many a banquet which endures too long,<br />
And many and daily feasts, are wont t' engender<br />
Insult and mockery; and those kind of jests<br />
Give far more pain than they do raise amusement.<br />
For such are the first ground of evil-speaking;<br />
And if you once begin t' attack your neighbour,<br />
You quickly do receive back all you bring,<br />
And then abuse and quarrels surely follow;<br />
Then blows and drunken riot. For this is<br />
The natural course of things, and needs no prophet.
</div>

<p>18. And Mnesimachus, in his Philip, on account of the immoderate
indulgence in suppers of people of his time, introduces an
entertainment which professes to be a preparation for war, and which
really is what that admirable writer Xenophon calls a workshop of war.
And he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Know you now with what men you must fight?<br />
With us, who sup upon well-sharpen'd swords,<br />
And swallow lighted firebrands for dainties:<br />
And then, for our dessert, our slaves bring in,<br />
After the first course, Cretan bows and arrows;<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 664]</span>

And, 'stead of vetches, broken heads of spears,<br />
And fragments of well-batter'd shields and breastplates;<br />
And at our feet lie slings, and stones, and bows,<br />
And on our heads are wreaths of catapults.
</div>

<p>And Phoenix the Colophonian says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A cask of wine shall be our sword&mdash;a cup<br />
Shall be our spear&mdash;our hair shall arrows be;<br />
Goblets shall be our enemies&mdash;wine our horses&mdash;<br />
Ointments and perfumes our war-cry fierce.
</div>

<p>And in the Parasite, Alexis, speaking of some very voracious person,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And all the younger men do call him parasite,<br />
Using a gentler name; but he cares not.<br />
And Telephus in speechless silence sits,<br />
Making but signs to those who ask him questions;<br />
So that the inviter often offers prayers<br />
To the great Samothracian gods o' the sea,<br />
To cease their blowing, and to grant a calm;<br />
For that young man's a storm to all his friends.
</div>

<p>And Diphilus, in his Hercules, speaking of some similar kind of person,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Do you not now behold me drunk and merry,<br />
Well fill'd with wine, and all inflamed with anger?<br />
Have not I just devour'd a dozen cakes,<br />
Every one larger than a good-sized shield?
</div>

<p>On which account, Bion of the Borysthenes said, cleverly enough, that
"A man ought not to derive his pleasures from the table, but from
meditation;" and Euripides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I pleased my palate with a frugal meal;
</div>

<p>signifying that the pleasure derived from eating and drinking is
chiefly limited to the mouth. And &AElig;schylus, in his Phineus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And many a most deceitful meal they snatch'd<br />
Away from hungry jaws, in haste t' enjoy<br />
The first delight of the too eager palate.
</div>

<p>And in his Stheneb&oelig;a, Euripides speaks of frugality thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A life at sea is a much troubled life,<br />
Not reinforced with pleasures of the table,<br />
But like a stable on the shore. The sea itself<br />
Is a moist mother, not a nurse on land;<br />
'Tis her we plough; from this our food, procured<br />
With nets and traps, comes daily home to us.
</div>

<p>19. For the belly is a great evil to man; concerning which Alexis
speaks, in his Men Dying together&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 665]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">STILPO.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
And hence you well may see how great an evil<br />
The belly is to man; what lessons strange<br />
It teaches, and what deeds it forces on us.<br />
If there were any power which could take<br />
This part alone from out our bodies, then<br />
No one would any more do injury<br />
Or insult to his neighbour. But from this<br />
Flow all the ills that harass human life.
</div>

<p>And Diphilus, in his Parasite, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Well did that wise Euripides oft speak,<br />
And this does seem his wisest word of all&mdash;<br />
"But want compels me and my wretched belly;"<br />
For there is nought more wretched than the belly:<br />
And into that you pour whate'er you have,<br />
Which you do not in any other vessel.<br />
Loaves you perhaps may in a wallet carry,&mdash;<br />
Not soup, or else you'll spoil it. So again,<br />
You put cakes in a basket, but not pulse;<br />
And wine into a bladder, but not crabs:<br />
But into this accursed belly, men<br />
Put every sort of inconsistent thing.<br />
I add no more; since it is plain enough<br />
That all men's errors are produced by it.
</div>

<p>And Crates the Cynic, as Sosicrates tells us in his Successions,
reproached Demetrius Phalereus for sending him a wallet of bread with
a flagon of wine. "I wish," said he, "that the fountains bore bread."
And Stilpo did not think himself guilty of intemperance when, having
eaten garlic, he went to sleep in the temple of the Mother of the Gods;
but all who eat of that food were forbidden even to enter into it. But
when the goddess appeared to him in his sleep, and said, "O Stilpo, do
you, though you are a philosopher, transgress the law?" he thought that
he made answer to her (still being asleep), "Do you give me something
better to eat, and I will not eat garlic."</p>

<p>20. After this, Ulpian said,&mdash;Since we have feasted
(<ins title="Greek: dedeipnamen">δεδείπναμεν</ins>) . . . . . . . . . And Alexis, in his Curis, has used this
expression, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Since we have long since supp'd (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnamen">δεδείπναμεν</ins>);
</div>

<p>and so has Eubulus, in his Procris&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But we have not yet supp'd (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnamen">δεδείπναμεν</ins>);
</div>

<p>and in another passage he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 666]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
A man who ought long since to have had supper (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnanai">δεδειπναναι</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Leonidas, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He will be here before we've finish'd supper (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnanai">δεδειπνάναι</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Proagon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
It's time for me to go now to my master,<br />
For by this time I think they all have supp'd (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnanai">δεδειπνάναι</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in his Danaides he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You now are insulting me in a drunken manner<br />
Before you've supp'd (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnanai">δεδειπνάναι</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Plato, in his Sophist, and Epicrates of Ambracia (and this last is
a poet of the middle comedy), in his Amazons, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For these men seem to me to have had their supper (<ins title="Greek: dedeipnanai">δεδειπνάναι</ins>)<br />
In capital season.
</div>

<p>And, on the same principle, Aristophanes has given us the form <ins title="Greek: êristamen">ἠρίσταμεν</ins>,
in his Men Frying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We've drank our fill, my men, and well have dined (<ins title="Greek: êristamen">ἠπίσταμεν</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Hermippus, in his Soldiers, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To dine (<ins title="Greek: aristanai">ἀριστάναι</ins>), and come to this man's house.
</div>

<p>And Theopompus, in his Call&aelig;schrus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We've dined (<ins title="Greek: êristamen">ἠρίσταμεν</ins>);&mdash;for I must this discourse cut short.
</div>

<p>But, in his Politician, Antipho has used the word <ins title="Greek: kataristan">καταριστᾶν</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When any one has all consumed in dinners (<ins title="Greek: kataristan">κατηρίστηκεν</ins>)<br />
His own estate, and that of all his family.
</div>

<p>And Amphis has used the word <ins title="Greek: paradedeipnêmenos">παραδεδειπνημένος</ins>, in his
Vagabond, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The boys who long ago have lost their dinner (<ins title="Greek: paradedeipnêmenoi">παραδεδειπνημένοι</ins>).
</div>

<p>21. "Let us, then, now," as Plato says in his Philebus, "pray to the
gods, and pour libations to them, whether it be Bacchus, or Vulcan, or
whoever else of the gods it may be, who has had the honour of having
our cups mixed for his sake. For there are two fountains by us, as
if we were cupbearers to mix the wine: and a person might compare a
fountain of pleasure to honey; but the fountain of wisdom, which is a
sober and wine-eschewing spring, to that of some hard but wholesome
water, which we must be very earnest to mix as well as possible." It
is, then, time for us now to drink wine; and let some one of the slaves
bring us goblets from the sideboard, for I see here a great variety of
beautiful and variously-ornamented drinking-cups. Accordingly, when a
large cup had been given to him, he said,&mdash;But, O boy, draw out and
pour into my cup a liquor with not quite so much water in it; not like
the man in the comic poet Antiphanes, who, in the Twins, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 667]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">MIXING WINE.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
He took and brought me an enormous cup,<br />
And I pour'd into it unmixed wine,<br />
Not to the honour of a boy, but all<br />
My cups, and they were numberless, I quaff'd<br />
To all the gods and goddesses of heaven.<br />
Then, after them, I drank twice as much more<br />
To the great goddess and the noble king.
</div>

<p>So do you now, O boy, pour me out something stronger; for I do not
prescribe to you the exact number of cyathi.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But I will show you
that the words <ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins> and <ins title="Greek: akratesteron">ἀκρατέστερον</ins> (wine with
less water in it) are both used: and then, too, I will give you a
lecture about cupbearers.</p>

<p>22. But, first of all, I will speak about the habit of drinking strong
drinks, with reference to which we find the word <ins title="Greek: zôroteron">ζωρότερον</ins>.
Antiphanes, in his Milanion, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I think this man does drink the cup of health,<br />
Making his cupbearer shun too much water (<ins title="Greek: zôroterô chrômenon oinochoô">ζωροτέρῳ χρώμενον οἰνοχόῳ</ins>).
</div>

<p>And in his Lampon he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
My friend Iapyx, mix it somewhat stronger (<ins title="Greek: euzôresteron">εὐζωρέστερον</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Ephippus, in his Ephebi, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He gave him in each hand a brimming flagon,<br />
Mixing in strong wine (<ins title="Greek: zôroteron">ζωρότερον</ins>), in Homer's fashion.
</div>

<p>And you find some people say that the expression in Homer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Take care and give less water (<ins title="Greek: zôroteron keraire">ζωρότερον κέραιρε</ins>),
</div>

<p>does not mean that there is to be less water, but that the draught is
to be hot; urging that <ins title="Greek: zôros">ζωρὸς</ins> is derived from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 668]</span>

<ins title="Greek: zôtikos">ζωτικὸς</ins> (giving life), and from <ins title="Greek: zesis">ζέσις</ins> (boiling);—for that, as there
were companions present, it would have been absurd to begin mixing the
cups of wine over again. But some say that the word is to be understood
as equivalent to <ins title="Greek: eukraton">εὔκρατον</ins> (well-mixed); just as we find the form
<ins title="Greek: dexion">δεξιτερὸν</ins> used instead of <ins title="Greek: dexion">δεξιόν</ins>. And some say that, since the year is
called <ins title="Greek: hôros">ὧρος</ins>, and since the particle <ins title="Greek: za">ζα</ins> indicates magnitude or number,
<ins title="Greek: zôros">ζῶρος</ins> means merely what has been made many years. And Diphilus, in his
Pederastæ, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pour me now out a cup of wine to drink;<br />
Give it, by Jove! <ins title="Greek: euzôroteron">εὐζωρότερον</ins> than that;<br />
For wat'ry things are ruinous to the stomach.
</div>

<p>And Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drinking, says that <ins title="Greek: zôroteron">ζωρότερον</ins>
means mixed; quoting the following lines of Empedocles;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And soon the things which formerly they learnt<br />
Immortal were, did mortal now become,<br />
And things unmix'd before became now mix'd (<ins title="Greek: zôra">ζωρὰ</ins>,)<br />
Changing their previous ways and habits all.
</div>

<p>23. And Plato has used the word <ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins> in the sense of a ladle, in his
Phaon, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Taking up thus the ladle (<ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins>) in their mouths.
</div>

<p>And in his Ambassadors he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He stole the ladles (<ins title="Greek: kyathoi">κύαθοι</ins>) every time he could.
</div>

<p>And Archippus, in his Fishes, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I bought a ladle (<ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins>) there from Dæsias.
</div>

<p>And there is a similar use of the word in the Peace of Aristophanes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
All having fought till they had got black eyes,<br />
Lying all on the ground around the <ins title="Greek: kyathoi">κύαθοι</ins>;
</div>

<p>for black eyes are reduced by having <ins title="Greek: kyathoi">κύαθοι</ins> (cupping glasses) applied
to them. Xenophon also speaks of the <ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins> in the first book of his
Cyropædia; and so does Cratinus; and, besides, so does Aristophanes
in many places, and Eubulus in his Orthanna; and Pherecrates, in his
Triflers, has spoken of a <ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins> made of silver. But Timon, in the
second book of his History of the Silli, has called <ins title="Greek: kyathoi, arysanai">κύαθοι, ἀρύσαναι</ins>;
speaking thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And <ins title="Greek: arysanai">ἀρύσαναι</ins>, hard to fill with wine;

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For I had these <ins title="Greek: arystichoi">ἀρύστιχοι</ins> near me.
</div>

<p>And Phrynichus, in his Weeding Women, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
(A cup) <ins title="Greek: kylik' arystichon">κύλικ᾽ ἀρύστιχον</ins>:
</div>

<p>and from this comes the word <ins title="Greek: arytaina">ἀρύταινα</ins>. They also called this vessel
<ins title="Greek: ephêbos">ἔφηβος</ins>, as Xenophanes did in his Relationship; and Polybius, in the
ninth book of his Histories, says that there is a certain river called
the Cyathus, near Arsinoe, a city in &AElig;tolia.</p>

<p>24. But the word <ins title="Greek: akratesteron">ἀκρατέστερον</ins>, meaning the same as <ins title="Greek: zôroteron">ζωρότερον</ins>, is used
by Hyperides in his oration against Demosthenes; where he writes
thus—“If any one drank any wine of much strength (<ins title="Greek: akratesteron">ἀκρατέστερον</ins>),
it grieved you.” And a similar form is <ins title="Greek: aniaresteron">ἀνιαρέστερον</ins>, and also the
expression in the Heliades of &AElig;schylus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: aphthonesteron liba">ἀφθονέστερον λίβα</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Epicharmus, in his Pyrrha, has the word <ins title="Greek: euônesteron">εὐωνέστερον</ins> (cheaper); and
Hyperides, in his Oration against Demades, has used the expression&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: rhadiesteran tên polin">ῥαδιεστέραν τὴν πόλιν</ins>.
</div>

<p>And as for the word <ins title="Greek: kerannyô]">κεραννύω</ins> (to mix), that is used by Plato in his
Philebus—“Let us, O Protarchus, pray to the gods, and mingle cups
(<ins title="Greek: kerannyômen">κεραννύωμεν</ins>) to pour libations to them.” And Alcæus, in his Sacred
Marriage, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They mix the cups (<ins title="Greek: kerannyômen">κεραννύουσιν</ins>) and drink them.
</div>

<p>And Hyperides, in his Delian Oration, says—“And the Greeks mix
(<ins title="Greek: kerannyousi">κεραννύουσι</ins>) the Panionian goblet all together."</p>

<p>And among the ancients they were the most nobly born youths who acted
as cupbearers; as, for instance, the son of Menelaus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the king's noble son pour'd out the wine.
</div>

<p>And Euripides the poet, when he was a boy, acted as cupbearer.
Accordingly, Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drinking, says&mdash;"But
I hear that Euripides the poet also acted as a cupbearer at Athens,
among those who are called the dancers: and these men were they who
used to dance around the temple of the Delian Apollo, being some of the
noblest of the Athenians, and they were clothed in garments of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 670]</span>

Ther&aelig;ans. And this is that Apollo in whose honour they celebrate the
Thargelian festival; and a writing concerning them is kept at Phyl&aelig;, in
the Daphnephorium." And Hieronymus the Rhodian gives the same account,
who was a disciple of Aristotle, and that too in a book of his entitled
a Treatise on Drunkenness. And the beautiful Sappho often praises her
brother Larichus, as having acted as cupbearer to the Mitylen&aelig;ans in
the Prytaneum. And among the Romans, the most nobly born of the youths
perform this office in the public sacrifices, imitating the &AElig;olians in
everything, as even in the tones of their voices.</p>

<p>25. And so great was the luxury of the ancients in respect of their
sumptuous meals, that they not only had cupbearers, but also men whom
they called &oelig;nopt&aelig; (inspectors of wines). At all events, the office of
&oelig;nopt&aelig; is a regular office among the Athenians; and it is mentioned by
Eupolis, in his play called The Cities, in the following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And men whom heretofore you'd not have thought<br />
Fit e'en to make &oelig;nopt&aelig; of, we now<br />
See made commanders. But oh, city, city!<br />
How much your fortune does out-run your sense.
</div>

<p>And these &oelig;nopt&aelig; superintended the arrangement of banquets,
taking care that the guests should drink on equal terms. But it was
an office of no great dignity, as Philinus the orator tells us, in
his debate on the Croconid&aelig;. And he tells us, too, that the
&oelig;nopt&aelig; were three in number, and that they also provided the
guests with lamps and wicks. And some people called them "eyes;" but
among the Ephesians, the youths who acted as cupbearers at the festival
of Neptune were called "bulls," as Amerias tells us. And the people of
the Hellespont call the cupbearer <ins title="Greek: epenchytês">ἐπεγχύτης</ins>,
or the pourer out; and they call carving, which we call
<ins title="Greek: kreônomia, kreôdaisia">κρεωνομία, κρεωδαισία</ins>, as Demetrius of
Scepsis tells us, in the twenty-sixth book of his Arrangement of the
Trojan Forces. And some say that the nymph Harmonia acted as cupbearer
to the gods; as Capito the epic poet relates (and he was a native of
Alexandria by birth), in the second book of his Love Poems. But Alcæus
also represents Mercury as their cupbearer; as also does Sappho, who
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And with ambrosia was a goblet mix'd,<br />
And Mercury pour'd it out to all the gods.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 671]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING.</div>

<p>26. But the ancients used to call the men who discharged this office,
heralds (<ins title="Greek: kêrykes">κήρυκες</ins>). Homer says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Meanwhile the heralds through the crowded town<br />
Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.<br />
Id&aelig;us's arms the golden goblets prest,<br />
Who thus the venerable king addrest.
</div>

<p>And a few lines further on he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
On either side a sacred herald stands;<br />
The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands<br />
Pour the full urn.
</div>

<p>But Clidemus says that the cooks used to be called heralds. And some
people have represented Hebe as acting as cupbearer to the gods,
perhaps because their banquets were called Hebeteria. And Ptolemy, the
son of Agesarchus, speaks of a damsel named Cleino as the cupbearer
of Ptolemy the king, who was surnamed Philadelphus, mentioning her
in the third book of his History of Philopator. But Polybius, in the
fourteenth book of his History, adds that there are statues of her in
Alexandria, in many parts of the city, clad in a tunic alone, holding a
cup in her hand.</p>

<p>27. And so, after this conversation, Ulpian drinking a goblet of wine,
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I drink this cup, a pledge of friendship dear,<br />
To all my kinsmen, naming them.
</div>

<p>And while he was still drinking, one of those who were present quoted
the rest of the passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace7">When I have drunk, I'll say</span><br />
The rest; for I am choked: but now drink this.
</div>

<p>And Ulpian, when he had drunk it up, said,&mdash;Clearchus has these lines
in his Harp-Player; but I, as is said in the Wool-spinners of Amphis,
recommend&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let the boy wait on all with frequent goblets.
</div>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">You fill for me, and I will give you drink;<br />
So shall the almond with the almond play:
</div>

<p>as Xenarchus says, in his Twins. And accordingly, when some of the
guests asked for more wine, and others wished to have it mixed
half-and-half, and when some one mentioned that Archippus, in the
second edition of his Amphitryon, said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 672]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
Wretch, who has mix'd for you this half-and-half?
</div>

<p>and that Cratinus had said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Giving him half-and-half; but I'm undone;
</div>

<p>every one seemed to agree to speak of the way of mixing wine among the
ancients.</p>

<p>28. And when some one mentioned that Menander, in his Hero, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Here is a measure of well-temper'd wine;<br />
Take it, and drink it up;&mdash;
</div>

<p>Democritus said&mdash;Hesiod, my friends, recommends men</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To pour three parts of water in the cup,<br />
And let the fourth part be the vinous juice.
</div>

<p>And, perhaps, it was on account of Hesiod that Anaxilas said, in his
Nereus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And this is much more pleasant; for I'd never<br />
Have drunk one part of wine to three of water.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Nurse, recommends even a more moderate mixture than
this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
See, here is wine. Shall I, then, give to Criton<br />
Equal proportions? This is better far,<br />
One part of wine to four of limpid water:<br />
Perhaps you'll call that weak; but still, when you<br />
Have drunk your fill of this, you'll find your head<br />
Clear for discussion,&mdash;and the drink lasts longer.
</div>

<p>And Diocles, in his Bees, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> In what proportions should the wine be mix'd?</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Four parts of water to two parts of wine.</span>
</div>

<p>And this mixture, as it is not that in ordinary use, put the questioner
in mind of the well-known proverb,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Drink waters three or five; but never four.
</div>

<p>What they mean is, You had better take two parts wine with five of
water, or one of wine to three of water. But, concerning this mixture,
Ion the poet, in his book on Chios, says that Palamedes the soothsayer
discovered and prophesied to the Greeks, that they would have a
favourable voyage if they drank one portion of wine to three of water.
But they, applying themselves to their drink very vigorously, took two
pints of wine to five of water;&mdash;accordingly Nicochares in his Amymone,
playing on the name, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Here, you &OElig;nomaus,&mdash;here, you two and five,&mdash;<br />
Let you and I now have a drink together.
</div>

<p>And he said nearly the same in his Lemnian Women: and Ameipsias, in his
Men Playing the Cottabus, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 673]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE PROPORTIONS OF MIXED WINE.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
But I (it is Bacchus who is represented as speaking) am five<br />
 and two to all of you.
</div>

<p>And Eupolis says, in his Goats,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Hail, my friend Bacchus, are you two to five?
</div>

<p>And Hermippus says, in his Gods,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Then, when we drink, or when we thirsty are,</span><br />
We pray our wine may be in due proportion.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> I do not bring it from a roguish wine-vault,</span><br />
Meaning to mock you: this which I do bring<br />

<p>29. But in Anacreon we find one measure of wine to two of water spoken
of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come, my boy, and bring to me<br />
Such a cup as I may drink<br />
At one easy draught: pour in<br />
Ten cyathi of water pure,<br />
And five of richest Chian wine;<br />
That I may drink, from fear removed,<br />
And free from drunken insolence.
</div>

<p>And going on presently, he calls the drinking of unmixed wine, a
Scythian draught&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come hither, now, and let us not<br />
Give way to vulgar shouts and noise,<br />
Indulging in the Scythian draughts<br />
While o'er our wine; but let us drink,<br />
Singing well-omen'd, pious hymns.
</div>

<p>And the Laced&aelig;monians, according to the statement of Herodotus, in
his sixth book, say that Cleomenes the king, having lived among the
Scythians, and got the habit of drinking unmixed wine, became perfectly
mad from his habit of drunkenness. And the Laced&aelig;monians themselves,
when they take it into their heads to drink hard, say that they are
Episcythising. Accordingly, Cham&aelig;leon of Heraclea, in his book on
Drunkenness, writes thus concerning them:&mdash;"Since the Laced&aelig;monians say
also, that Cleomenes the Spartan became mad from having lived among the
Scythians, and there learnt to drink unmixed wine; on which account,
when they take a fancy to drink unmixed wine they desire their slaves
to pour out in the Scythian fashion." And Ach&aelig;us, in his &AElig;thon, a
satyric drama, represents the Satyrs as indignant at being compelled to
drink their wine watered, and as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Was the whole Achelous in this wine?<br />
But even then this race would not cease drinking,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 674]</span>

For this is all a Scythian's happiness.
</div>

<p>30. But the habit of pouring libations of pure wine, as Theophrastus
says, in his treatise on Drinking, was not ancient; but originally
libations were what is given to the Gods, and the cottabus, what was
devoted to the object of one's love. For men practised throwing the
cottabus with great care, it being originally a Sicilian sport, as
Anacreon the Teian says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Throwing, with his well-bent arm<br />
The Sicilian cottabus.
</div>

<p>On which account those songs of the ancient poets, which are called
scolia, are full of mention of the cottabus.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
I mean, for instance, such a scolion as Pindar composed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And rightly I adore the Graces,<br />
Nymphs of Venus and of Love,<br />
While drinking with a loving heart<br />
This sounding cottabus I pour<br />
To Agathon, my heart's delight.
</div>

<p>And they also consecrated to those of their friends who were dead, all
that portion of their victuals which fell from their tables. On which
account Euripides says of Sthenob&oelig;a, when she thinks that Bellerophon
is dead&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Nothing escaped her from her hand which fell,<br />
But in a moment she did couple it<br />
With the loved name of the Corinthian stranger.
</div>

<p>31. But the ancients were not in the habit of getting drunk. But
Pittacus recommended Periander of Priene not to get drunk, nor to
become too much addicted to feasting, "so that," says he, "it may not
be discovered what sort of a person you really are, and that you are
not what you pretend to be."&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 675]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
For brass may be a mirror for the face,&mdash;<br />
Wine for the mind.
</div>

<p>On which account they were wise men who invented the proverb, "Wine has
no rudder." Accordingly, Xenophon the son of Gryllus, (when once at the
table of Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily, the cupbearer was compelling
the guests to drink,) addressed the tyrant himself by name, and said,
"Why, O Dionysius, does not also the confectioner, who is a skilful man
in his way, and one who understands a great many different recipes for
dressing things, compel us also, when we are at a banquet, to eat even
when we do not wish to; but why, on the contrary, does he spread the
table for us in an orderly manner, in silence?" And Sophocles, in one
of his Satyric dramas, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To be compell'd to drink is quite as hard<br />
As to be forced to bear with thirst.
</div>

<p>From which also is derived the saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Wine makes an old man dance against his will.
</div>

<p>And Sthenelus the poet said very well&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Wine can bring e'en the wise to acts of folly.
</div>

<p>And Phocylides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
It should be a rule for all wine-bibbing people<br />
Not to let the jug limp round the board like a cripple,<br />
But gaily to chat while enjoying their tipple:
</div>

<p>and to this day this custom prevails among some of the Greeks. But
since they have begun to be luxurious and have got effeminate they have
given up their chairs and taken to couches; and having taken indolence
and laziness for their allies, they have indulged in drinking in an
immoderate and disorderly manner; the very way in which the tables were
laid contributing, as I imagine, to luxury.</p>

<p>32. And it is on this account that Hesiod, in his Eo&aelig;, has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What joys and also what exceeding pains<br />
Has Bacchus given to mortal men who drink,<br />
Indulging in excess: for to such men<br />
Wine is an insolent master, binding fast<br />
Their feet and hands, their tongues and intellects,<br />
With chains unspeakable, unnoticeable;<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 676]</span>

And tender sleep loves on their eyes to fall.
</div>

<p>And Theognis says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I come like wine, the sweetest drink of men,&mdash;<br />
I am not sober, nor yet very drunk;<br />
But he who goes to great excess in drink<br />
Is no more master of his mind or senses;<br />
Then he talks unintelligible nonsense.<br />
Which seems to sober men a shameful thing;<br />
But he, when drunk, is not ashamed of anything,<br />
E'en though at other times a modest man<br />
And gentle-minded. Mind you this, my friend,<br />
And don't indulge in drinking to excess,<br />
But rise from table ere the wine begins<br />
To take effect; nor let your appetite<br />
Reduce you to become its daily slave.
</div>

<p>But Anacharsis the philosopher, wishing to exhibit the power of
the vine to the king of the Scythians, and showing him some of its
branches, said that if the Greeks did not prune it every year it would
by this time have reached to Scythia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 677]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING.</div>

<p>33. But those men do not act wisely who represent and describe Bacchus
in their statues or pictures, and who also lead him through the middle
of the market-place on a waggon, as if he were drunk; for, by so doing,
they show the beholders that wine is stronger than the god. And I do
not think that even a good and wise man could stand this. And if they
have represented him in this state because he first showed us the
use of wine, it is plain that for the same reason they should always
represent Ceres as reaping corn or eating bread. And I should say that
&AElig;schylus himself erred in this particular; for he was the first person
(and not Euripides, as some people say,) who introduced the appearance
of drunken people into a tragedy. For in his Cabiri he introduces Jason
drunk. But the fact is, that the practices which the tragedian himself
used to indulge in, he attributed to his heroes: at all events he used
to write his tragedies when he was drunk; on which account Sophocles
used to reproach him, and say to him, "O &AElig;schylus,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
even if you do what you ought, at all events you do so without knowing
it;" as Cham&aelig;leon tells us, in his treatise on &AElig;schylus. And they
are ignorant people who say that Epicharmus was the first person who
introduced a drunken man on the stage, and after him Crates, in his
Neighbours. And Alc&aelig;us the lyric poet, and Aristophanes the comic poet,
used to write their poems when they were drunk. And many other men have
fought with great gallantry in war when they were drunk. But among the
Epizephyrian Locrians, if any one drank untempered wine, except by the
express command of his physician for the sake of his health, he was
liable to be punished with death, in accordance with a law to that
effect passed by Zaleucus.</p>

<p>And among the people of Massilia there was a law that the women should
drink water only. And Theophrastus says, that to this day that is the
law at Miletus. And among the Romans no slave ever drank wine, nor
any free woman, nor any youth born of free parents till he was thirty
years of age. And Anacreon is very ridiculous for having referred all
his poems to the subject of drunkenness; for, owing to this, he is
found fault with as having in his poems wholly abandoned himself to
effeminacy and luxury, as the multitude are not aware that while he
wrote he was a sober and virtuous man, who pretended to be a drunkard,
when there was no necessity at all for his doing so.</p>

<p>34. And men who are ignorant of the power of wine, say that Bacchus is
the cause of madness to men; in saying which they abuse wine in a very
senseless manner. On which account Melanippides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
All men have detested water<br />
Who did not before have wine;<br />
And though some have enjoy'd their cups,<br />
Others have turn'd to ravings wild.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drinking, says, "If the wine be
moderately boiled, then when it is drunk, it is less apt to intoxicate;
for, as some of its power has been boiled away, it has become weaker."
And he also says, "Old men become drunk more quickly on account of
the small quantity of natural warmth which there is in them, and also
of the weak-genius get drunk very quickly, on account of the great

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 678]</span>

quantity of natural warmth that there is in them; for, in consequence,
they are easily subdued by the warmth proceeding from the wine which is
added to their natural warmth. And some of the brute beasts are also
capable of becoming intoxicated; such as pigs when they are filled with
the husks of pressed grapes; and the whole race of crows, and of dogs,
when they have eaten of the herb called &oelig;nussa: and the monkey and the
elephant get intoxicated if they drink wine; on which account they hunt
monkeys and crows when the former have been made drunk with wine, and
the latter with &oelig;nussa.</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But to drink unceasingly&mdash;
</div>

<p>as Crobylus says, in his Woman who deserted her Husband&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace10">Can have</span><br />
No pleasure in it, surely; how should it,<br />
When it deprives a living man of power<br />
To think as he should think? and yet is thought<br />
The greatest blessing that is given to man.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in the revised edition of his Phrygian, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If now men only did their headaches get<br />
Before they get so drunk, I'm sure that no one<br />
Would ever drink more than a moderate quantity:<br />
But now we hope t' escape the penalty<br />
Of our intemperance, and so discard<br />
Restraint, and drink unmixed cups of wine.
</div>

<p>And Aristotle says, that the wine called the Samagorean wine was so
strong that more than forty men were made drunk with a pint and a half
of it after it had been mixed with water.</p>

<p>35. Democritus having said this, and having drunk, said,&mdash;Now if any
one can gainsay any of these statements let him come forward: and then
he shall be told, as Evenus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
That may be your opinion; this is mine.
</div>

<p>But I, since I have now made this digression about the mixtures of the
ancients, will resume the thread of my original discourse where I let
it drop; considering what was said by Alc&aelig;us the lyric poet. For he
speaks, somewhere or other, in this way&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pour out, in just proportion, one and two.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 679]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING.</div>

<p>For in these words some people do not think that he is alluding to
the mixture of wine and water at all; but that, being a moderate and
temperate man, he would not drink
more than one cyathus of pure wine, or perhaps, at the most, two. And
this is the interpretation given to the passage by Cham&aelig;leon of Pontus,
who was ignorant how fond of wine Alc&aelig;us had been. For this poet will
be found to have been in the habit of drinking at every season and in
every imaginable condition of affairs. In winter he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now the storm begins to lower,<br />
And Jove descends in heavy snow,<br />
And streams of water stand congeal'd<br />
In cruel ice: let's drive away<br />
The wintry cold, and heap up fire,<br />
And mingle with unsparing hand<br />
The honied cup, and wreathe our brows<br />
With fragrant garlands of the season.
</div>

<p>And in summer, he writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now it behoves a man to soak his lungs<br />
In most cool wine; for the fierce dogstar rages,<br />
And all things thirst with the excessive heat.
</div>

<p>And in spring, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now does the flowery spring return,<br />
And shed its gifts all o'er the land;
</div>

<p>and he continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come then, my boy, and quickly pour<br />

<p>And in his misfortunes he sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
One must not give one's thoughts up wholly<br />
To evil fortune; for by grieving<br />
We shall not do ourselves much good.<br />
Come to me, Bacchus; you are ever<br />
The best of remedies, who bring<br />
Us wine and joyous drunkenness.
</div>

<p>And in his hours of joy he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now is the time to get well drunk,<br />
Now e'en in spite of self to drink,<br />
Since Myrsilus is dead at last.
</div>

<p>And, giving some general advice, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Never plant any tree before the vine.

<p>How, then, could a man who was so very devoted to drinking be a sober
man, and be content with one or two cups of wine? At all events, his
very poem, says Seleucus, testifies against those people who receive
the line in this sense. For he says, in the whole passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let us now drink,&mdash;why put we out the light?<br />
Our day is but a finger: bring large cups,<br />

<p>In which words he plainly enough intimates that his meaning is, that
one cup of wine is to be mixed with two of water.</p>

<p>36. But Anacreon likes his liquors stronger still; as is shown by the
verses in which he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let the cup well be clean'd, then let it hold<br />
Five measures water, three of rosy wine.

<p>And Philet&aelig;rus, in his Tereus, speaks of two measures of water to three
of wine. And he speaks thus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I seem to have drunk two measures now of water,<br />
And only three of wine.
</div>

<p>And Pherecrates, in his Corianno, speaks even of two measures of water
to four of wine, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He was no master of the feast at all,<br />

<p>And it was not without some wit that Lysander the Spartan, as
Hegesander relates in his Commentaries, when some vintners sold wine
which had been much watered in his camp, ordered some one to supply it
properly tempered, that his men might buy it with less water in it. And
Alexis has said something which comes to nearly the same thing, in his
&AElig;sop; thus&mdash;</p>

This now is, as you see, a Grecian drink;<br />
So that men, drinking cups of moderate strength,<br />

For too much water is more like a bath<br />
Than like a wine-cup; and the wine-cooler<br />

<p>39. "But to drink to the degree of drunkenness," says Plato, in his
sixth book of the Laws, is neither becoming anywhere&mdash;except perhaps
in the days of festival of the god who gave men wine for their
banquets,&mdash;nor is it wholesome: and, above all, a man ought to guard
against such a thing who has any thoughts of marriage; for at such a
time, above all other times, both bride and bridegroom ought to be in
full possession of their faculties; when they are entering upon what
is no small change in the circumstances of their life; and also they
ought to be influenced by anxiety that their offspring shall be the
offspring of parents in the fullest possible possession of all their
faculties; for it is very uncertain what day or what night will be
the originating cause of it." And in the first book of his Laws he
says&mdash;"But respecting drunkenness it may be a question, whether we
ought to give way to it as the Lydians do, and the Persians, and the
Carthaginians, and the Celt&aelig;, and the Spaniards, and the Thracians,
and other nations like them; or whether like you, O Laced&aelig;monians, one
ought wholly to abstain from it. But the Scythians and the Thracians,
who indulge altogether in drinking unmixed wine, both the women and all
the men, and who spill it all over their clothes, think that they are
maintaining a very honourable practice, and one that tends to their
happiness. And the Persians indulge to a great extent in other modes
of luxury which you reject; but still they practise them with more
moderation than the Scythians and Thracians.</p>

<p>40. And a great many of the guests were drinking, and putting lumps of
meal into their wine, a custom which Hegesander of Delphi mentions.
Accordingly Epinicus, when Mnesiptolemus had given a recitation of his
history, in which it was written how Seleucus had used meal in his
wine, having written a drama entitled Mnesiptolemus, and having turned
him into ridicule, as the comic poets do, and using his own words about
that sort of drink, represents him as saying:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 683]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">LACED&AElig;MONIAN FASHIONS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Once I beheld the noble king Seleucus,<br />
One summer's day, drinking with mighty pleasure<br />
Some wine with meal steep'd in it. (So I took<br />
A note of it, and show'd it to a crowd,<br />
Although it was an unimportant thing,<br />
Yet still my genius could make it serious.)<br />
He took some fine old Thasian wine, and eke<br />
Some of the liquor which the Attic bee<br />
Distils who culls the sweets from every flower;<br />
And that he mingled in a marble cup,<br />
And mix'd the liquor with fair Ceres' corn,<br />
And took the draught, a respite from the heat.
</div>

<p>And the same writer tells us that in the Therades islands men mash
lentils and pease into meal, instead of ordinary corn, and put that
into the wine, and that this drink is said to be better than that in
which the meal is mixed.</p>

<p>41. Now it was not the fashion among the Laced&aelig;monians to practise the
system of pledging healths at their banquets, nor to salute one another
with mutual greetings and caresses at their feasts. And Critias shows
us this in his Elegies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And this is an old fashion, well establish'd,<br />
And sanction'd by the laws of noble Sparta,<br />
That all should drink from one well-fill'd cup;<br />
And that no healths should then be drunk to any one,<br />
Naming the tender object: also that<br />
The cup should not go round towards the right.<br />
The Lydian goblets . . . . . .<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*

<br />

And to drink healths with skill and well-turn'd phrase,<br />
Naming the person whom one means to pledge.<br />
For, after draughts like this, the tongue gets loose,<br />
And turns to most unseemly conversation;<br />
They make the body weak; they throw a mist<br />
Over the eyes; and make forgetfulness<br />
Eat recollection out of the full heart.<br />
The mind no longer stands on solid ground;<br />
The slaves are all corrupted by licentiousness,<br />
And sad extravagance eats up the house.<br />
But those wise youths whom Laced&aelig;mon breeds<br />
Drink only what may stimulate their souls<br />
To deeds of daring in th' adventurous war,<br />
And rouse the tongue to wit and moderate mirth.<br />
Such draughts are wholesome both for mind and body,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 684]</span>

And not injurious to the pocket either:<br />
Good, too, for deeds of love; authors of sleep,<br />
That wholesome harbour after toil and care:<br />
Good, too, for health&mdash;that best of goddesses<br />
Who mortal man befriend: and likewise good<br />
For piety's best neigbour temperance.
</div>

<p>And presently afterwards he goes on&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For fierce, immoderate draughts of heady wine<br />
Give momentary pleasure, but engender<br />
A long-enduring pain which follows it.<br />
But men at Sparta love a mode of life<br />

That which is wholesome, so that they may be<br />
Fit to endure hard pains, and do great deeds.<br />
Nor have they stated days in all the year,<br />

<p>42. And a man who is always ready for wine is called <ins title="Greek: philoinos">φίλοινος</ins>. But
he is called <ins title="Greek: philopotês">φιλοπότης</ins> who is always ready to drink anything; and he
is called <ins title="Greek: philokôthônistês">φιλοκωθωνιστὴς</ins> who drinks to the degree of drunkenness. And
of all heroes, the greatest drinker is Nestor, who lived three times
as long as other men; for he evidently used to stick to his wine more
closely than other people, and even than Agamemnon himself, whom
Achilles upbraids as a man given to much drinking. But Nestor, even
when a most important battle was impending, could not keep away from
drinking. Accordingly Homer says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But not the genial feast or flowing bowl<br />
Gould charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul.
</div>

<p>And he is the only hero whose drinking-cup he has described, as he has
the shield of Achilles; for he went to the war with his goblet just as
he did with that shield, the fame of which Hector says had reached to
heaven. And a man would not be very wrong who called that cup of his
the Goblet of Mars, like the C&aelig;neus of Antiphanes, in which it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The hero stood and brandish'd Mars's cup,<br />
Like great Timotheus, and his polish'd spear.
</div>

<p>And indeed it was on account of his fondness for drinking that Nestor,
in the games instituted in honour of Patroclus, received a drinking-cup
as a present from Achilles; not but what Achilles also gave a cup
to the competitor who was defeated: for victory does not commonly
attend hard drinkers, on account of their usual inactivity; or perhaps
it is owing to their thirst that boxers usually fail, from being
fatigued with holding out their hands too long. But Eumelus receives
a breastplate after having run a course with great danger, and having
been torn, the breastplate being a serviceable piece of defensive
armour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 685]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THIRST.</div>

<p>43. But there is nothing more covetous than thirst; on which account
the poet has called Argos thirsty, or rather causing great thirst, as
having been much desired on account of the length of time the person
of whom he is speaking had been absent from it. For thirst engenders
in all men a violent desire for abundant enjoyment; on which account
Sophocles says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Though you were to unfold unnumber'd treasures<br />
Of wisdom to a thirsty man, you'd find<br />
You pleased him less than if you gave him drink.
</div>

<p>And Archilochus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I wish to fight with you, as much as e'er<br />
A thirsty man desired to quench his thirst.
</div>

<p>And one of the tragic poets has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I bid you check your hand which thirsts for blood.
</div>

<p>And Anacreon says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For you are kind to every stranger,<br />
So let me drink and quench my thirst.
</div>

<p>And Xenophon, in the third book of his Cyrop&aelig;dia, represents Cyrus as
speaking in this manner:&mdash;"I thirst to gratify you." And Plato, in
his Polity, says&mdash;"But if, as I imagine, any city which is governed
by a democracy, thirsting for its liberty, should have evil-disposed
cupbearers to wait upon it, and should be intoxicated to an improper
degree with unmixed wine . . . ."</p>

<p>44. Proteas the Macedonian was also a very great drinker, as Ephippus
tells us in his treatise on the Funeral of Alexander and Heph&aelig;stion:
and he had an admirable constitution, and he had practised drinking to
a great degree. Accordingly, Alexander, having once asked for a cup
containing two choes, and having drank from it, pledged Proteas; and
he, having taken it, and having sung the praises of the king a great
deal, drank it in such a manner as to be applauded by every one. And
presently Proteas asked for the same cup again, and again he drank
and pledged the king. And Alexander, having taken the cup, drank it
off in a princely manner, but he could not stand it, but leaned back
on the pillow, letting the cup fall from his hands; and after this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 686]</span>

he fell sick and died, Bacchus, as it is said, being angry with him
because he had besieged his native city of Thebes. And Alexander
drank a great deal too, so that he once, after a drunken bout, slept
without interruption two days and two nights. And this is shown in his
Journals, which were compiled by Eumenes the Cardian, and Diodotus the
Erythr&aelig;an. But Menander, in his Flatterer, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace15"><i>A.</i> My good friend, Struthias, I thrice have drunk</span><br />
<span class="linespace4">A golden cup in Cappadocia,</span><br />
<span class="linespace4">Containing ten full cotyl&aelig; of wine.</span><br />
<i>St.</i> Why, then you drank more than king Alexander.<br />
<span class="linespace15"><i>A.</i> At all events not less, I swear by Pallas.</span><br />
<i>St.</i> A wondrous feat.
</div>

<p>But Nicobule, or whoever it was who wrote the books attributed to her,
says that "Alexander, once supping with Medeus the Thessalian, when
there were twenty people present at the party, pledged every one of the
guests, receiving a similar pledge from all of them, and then, rising
up from the party, he presently went off to sleep." And Callisthenes
the Sophist, as Lynceus the Samian says in his Commentaries, and
Aristobulus and Chares in their Histories, when in a banquet given by
Alexander, a cup of unmixed wine came to him, rejected it; and when
some one said to him, Why do you not drink? "I do not wish," said he,
"after having drunk the cup of Alexander, to stand in need of the cup
of &AElig;sculapius."</p>

<p>45. But Darius, who destroyed the Magi, had an inscription written
on his tomb,&mdash;"I was able to drink a great deal of wine, and to bear
it well." And Ctesias says, that among the Indians it is not lawful
for the king to get drunk; but among the Persians it is permitted to
the king to get drunk one day in the year,&mdash;the day, namely, on which
they sacrifice to Mithras. And Duris writes thus, with respect to this
circumstance, in the seventh book of his Histories:&mdash;"The king gets
drunk and dances the Persian dance on that festival only which is
celebrated by the Persians in honour of Mithras; but no one else does
so in all Asia; but all abstain during this day from dancing at all.
For the Persians learn to dance as they learn to ride; and they think
that the motion originated by this sort of exercise contains in it a
good kind of practice tending to the strength of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 687]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PHILIP OF MACEDON.</div>

<p>But Alexander used to get so drunk, as Carystius of Pergamus relates
in his Historic Commentaries, that he used even to celebrate banquets
in a chariot drawn by asses; and the Persian kings too, says he did
the same thing. And perhaps it was owing to this that he had so little
inclination for amatory pleasures; for Aristotle, in his Problems of
Natural History, says, that the powers of men who drink to any great
excess are much weakened. And Hieronymus, in his Letters, says, that
Theophrastus says, that Alexander was not much of a man for women;
and accordingly, when Olympias had given him Callixene, a Thessalian
courtesan, for a mistress, who was a most beautiful woman, (and all
this was done with the consent of Philip, for they were afraid that he
was quite impotent,) she was constantly obliged to ask him herself to
do his duty by her.</p>

<p>46. And Philip, the father of Alexander, was a man very fond of
drinking, as Theopompus relates in the twenty-sixth book of his
History. And in another part of his History he writes, "Philip was a
man of violent temper and fond of courting dangers, partly by nature,
and partly too from drinking; for he was a very hard drinker, and
very often he would attack the enemy while he was drunk." And in his
fifty-third book, speaking of the things that took place at Ch&aelig;ronea,
and relating how he invited to supper the ambassadors of the Athenians
who were present there, he says, "But Philip, when they had gone away,
immediately sent for some of his companions, and bade the slaves summon
the female flute-players, and Aristonicus the harp-player, and Durion
the flute-player, and all the rest who were accustomed to drink with
him; for Philip always took people of that sort about with him, and
he had also invented for himself many instruments for banquets and
drinking-parties; for being very fond of drinking and a man intemperate
in his manners, he used to keep a good many buffoons and musicians and
professed jesters about him. And when he had spent the whole night
in drinking, and had got very drunk and violent, he then dismissed
all the rest, and when it was day-break proceeded in a riotous manner
to the ambassadors of the Athenians. And Carystius in his Historical
Commentaries says, that Philip, when he intended to get drunk, spoke in
this way: "Now we may drink; for it is quite sufficient if Antipater is
sober." And once, when he was playing at dice, and some one told him

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 688]</span>

that Antipater was coming, he hesitated a moment, and then thrust the
board under the couch.</p>

<p>47. And Theopompus gives a regular catalogue of men fond of drinking
and addicted to drunkenness; and among them he mentions the younger
Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, whose eyes were a good deal injured
by wine. And Aristotle, in his Polity of the Syracusans, says that
he sometimes was drunk for three months at a time together, owing to
which he had got somewhat weak in the eyes. And Theophrastus says
that his companions also, who were flatterers of the supreme power,
pretended not to see well, and to be led by the hand by Dionysius, and
not to be able to see the meat that was served up before them, nor the
cups of wine, on which account they got the name of Dionysiocolaces,
or flatterers of Dionysius. Nys&aelig;us also, who was tyrant of Syracuse,
drank a great deal, and so did Apollocrates; and these men were the
sons of the former Dionysius, as Theopompus tells us in the fortieth
and forty-first books of his History; and he writes thus about Nys&aelig;us:
"Nys&aelig;us, who was afterwards tyrant of Syracuse, when he was taken for
the purpose of being put to death, and knew that he had only a few
months to live, spent them wholly in eating and drinking." And in his
thirty-ninth book he says: "Apollocrates, the son of Dionysius the
tyrant, was an intemperate man, and addicted to drinking; and some
of his flatterers worked upon him so as to alienate him as much as
possible from his father." And he says that Hipparinus, the son of
Dionysius, who behaved like a tyrant when drunk, was put to death.
And about Nys&aelig;us he writes as follows: "Nys&aelig;us, the son of the elder
Dionysius, having made himself master of Syracuse, got a four-horse
chariot, and put on an embroidered robe, and devoted himself to
gluttony and hard drinking, and to insulting boys and ravishing women,
and to all other acts which are consistent with such conduct. And he
passed his life in this manner." And in his forty-fifth book the same
historian, speaking of Timolaus the Theban, says: "For though there
have been a great many men who have been intemperate in their daily
life, and in their drinking, I do not believe that there has ever
been any one who was concerned in state affairs, more intemperate,
or a greater glutton, or a more complete slave to his pleasures than
Timolaus, whom I
have mentioned." And in his twenty-third book, speaking of Charidemus
of Oreum, whom the Athenians made a citizen, he says: "For it was
notorious that he spent every day in the greatest intemperance, and
in such a manner that he was always drinking and getting drunk, and
endeavouring to seduce free-born women; and he carried his intemperance
to such a height that he ventured to beg a young boy, who was very
beautiful and elegant, from the senate of the Olynthians, who had
happened to be taken prisoner in the company of Derdas the Macedonian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 689]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ARCADION.</div>

<p>48. A man of the name of Arcadion, too, was a very great drinker,
(but it is uncertain whether this is the same man who was at enmity
with Philip,) as the epigram shows which Polemo has preserved in his
treatise on the Inscriptions existing in different Cities&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This is the monument of that great drinker,<br />
Arcadion; and his two loving sons,<br />
Dorcon and Charmylus, have placed it here,<br />
At this the entrance of his native city:<br />
And know, traveller, the man did die<br />
From drinking strong wine in too large a cup.
</div>

<p>And the inscription over some man of the name of Erasixenus says that
he also drank a great deal.</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Twice was this cup, full of the strongest wine,<br />
Drain'd by the thirsty Erasixenus,<br />
And then in turn it carried him away.

<p>Alcetas the Macedonian also used to drink a great deal, as Aristos
the Salaminian relates; and so did Diotimus the Athenian: and he was
the man who was surnamed the Funnel. For he put a funnel into his
mouth, and would then drink without ceasing while the wine was being
poured into it, according to the account of Polemo. And it has been
already mentioned that Cleomenes the Laced&aelig;monian was a great drinker
of unmixed wine; and that in consequence of his drunkenness he cut
himself to pieces with a sword, is related by Herodotus. And Alc&aelig;us
the poet also was very fond of drinking, as I have already mentioned.
And Baton of Sinope, in his essay on Ion the poet, says that Ion was
a man fond of drinking and amorous to excess; and he himself, too, in
his Elegies, confesses that he loved Chrysilla the Corinthian, the
daughter of Teleas, with whom Teleclides, in his Hesiods, says that the
Olympian<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Pericles also was in love. And Xenarchus the Rhodian, on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 690]</span>

account of the excessive way in which he used to drink, was surnamed
"The Nine-gallon Cask;" and Euphorion the Epic poet mentions him in his
Chiliades.</p>

<p>49. And Chares the Mitylen&aelig;an, in his History of Alexander, speaking
of Calanus the Indian philosopher, and saying that he threw himself
on a funeral pile that had been raised, and so died, says also that
Alexander instituted some gymnastic games at his tomb, and also a
musical contest of panegyrics on him.&mdash;"And he instituted," says
Chares, "because of the great fondness of the Indians for wine, a
contest as to who should drink the greatest quantity of unmixed wine;
and the prize was a talent for the first, and thirty min&aelig; for the
second, and ten min&aelig; for the third. And of those who entered for the
prize and drank the wine, thirty-five died at once by reason of the
cold; and a little afterwards six more died in their tents. And he who
drank the greatest quantity and won the prize, drank four choes of
unmixed wine, and received the talent; and he lived four days after
it; and he was called the Champion." And Tim&aelig;us says that "Dionysius
the tyrant gave, at the festival of the Choes, to the first man who
should drink a choeus, a golden crown as a prize:" and he says also
that "Xenocrates the philosopher was the first person who drank it;
and that he, taking the golden crown, and departing, offered it up to
the Mercury who was placed in his vestibule, on which statue he was
always accustomed on every occasion to offer up the garlands of flowers
which he had, every evening as he returned home; and he was much
admired for this conduct." And Phanodemus says, that the festival of
the Choes was established at Athens by Demophoon the king, when he was
desirous to receive Orestes in hospitality on his arrival at Athens.
And that, as he did not like him to come to the temples, or to share
in the libations offered to the gods, before his trial was decided,
he ordered all the temples to be shut, and a choeus of wine to be set
before everybody, saying that a cheesecake should be given as a prize
to the first person who drank it up. And he bade them, when they had
finished drinking, not to offer up the garlands, with which they had
been crowned, in the temples, because they had been under the same roof
with Orestes; but he desired each man to place his garland round his
own cup, and so to bring them to the priestess at the temple which is
in the Marshes, and
after that to perform the rest of the sacred ceremonies in the temple.
And from thence it was that this festival got the name of the Choes.
But on the day of the festival of the Choes, it is customary for the
Athenians to send presents and pay to the sophists, who also themselves
invite their acquaintances to a banquet, as Eubulides the dialectician
shows us in his drama entitled the Revellers, where he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 691]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DIONYSIUS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>50. But Antigonus the Carystian, in his essay on the Life of Dionysius
of Heraclea, who was called the Turncoat, says that Dionysius, when he
was feasting with his slaves at the festival of the Choes, and was not
able, by reason of his old age, to avail himself of the courtesan whom
they brought him, turned round and said to those who were feasting with
him&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I cannot now, so let another take her.
</div>

<p>But Dionysius, as Nicias of Nic&aelig;a tells us in his Successions, had
been from the time he was a boy very furious in the indulgence of
his amorous propensities; and he used to go to all the common women
promiscuously. And once, when walking with some of his acquaintances,
when he came near the house where the girls are kept, and where,
having been there the day before, he had left some money owing, as he
happened to have some with him then, he put out his hand and paid it
in the presence of all of them. And Anacharsis the Scythian, when a
prize for drinking was proposed at the table of Periander, demanded the
prize, because he was the first man to be drunk of all the guests who
were present; as if to get to the end were the goal to be aimed at,
and the victory to be achieved in drinking as in running a race. But
Lacydes and Timon the philosophers, being invited to an entertainment
which was to last two days, by one of their friends, and wishing to
adapt themselves to the rest of the guests, drank with great eagerness.
And accordingly, in the first day, Lacydes went away first, as soon
as he was quite satiated with drink. And Timon, seeing him as he was
departing, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now have we gain'd immortal praise and fame,<br />
Since we have slain great Hector. . . .
</div>

<p>But on the next day Timon went away first because he could not drink

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 692]</span>

up the goblet in which he had been pledged, and Lacydes seeing him
departing, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Wretched are they who dare encounter me.
</div>

<p>51. And Herodotus, in his second book, relates that Mycerinus the
Egyptian, having been told by the soothsayers that he was fated to
live but a short time, used to light a great number of lamps when
night arrived, and spend all his time in drinking and luxury, relaxing
neither by day nor by night; and when he withdrew into the marshes
and into the groves, or wherever he heard that there were meetings of
young people to amuse themselves, he always got drunk. And Herodotus
tells us that Amasis also, who was another of the Egyptian kings, was
a very hard drinker indeed. And Hermeas the Methymn&aelig;an, in the third
book of his History of Sicily, says that Nicoteles the Corinthian was a
man greatly addicted to drinking. And Ph&aelig;nias the Eresian, in the book
entitled, The Slaying of Tyrants out of Revenge, says that Scopas the
son of Creon, and the grandson of the former Scopas, was throughout
his whole life very fond of drinking; and that he used to return from
banquets at which he had been present, sitting on a throne, and carried
by four palanquin-bearers, and in that way he used to enter his house.
And Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories, says that Antiochus
the king was a man very fond of wine; and that he used to get drunk,
and then go to sleep for a long time, and then, as evening came on, he
would wake up, and drink again. And it was very seldom, says he, that
he transacted the affairs of his kingdom when he was sober, but much
more frequently when he was drunk; on which account there were two
men about him who managed all the real business of the state as they
pleased, namely Aristos and Themiso, Cyprians by birth, and brothers;
and they were both on terms of the greatest intimacy with Antiochus.</p>

<p>52. And Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Epiphanes, was also a
great drinker,&mdash;the one, I mean, who had been a hostage among the
Romans, whom Ptolemy Euergetes mentions in the third book of his
Commentaries, and also in the fifth; saying that he turned to Indian
revellings and drunkenness, and spent a vast quantity of money in those
practices; and for the rest of the money which he had at hand, he spent</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 693]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES.</div>

<p>a part of it in his daily revels, and the rest he would scatter about,
standing in the public streets, and saying, "Let whoever chance gives
it to, take it:" and then, throwing the money about, he would depart.
And very often, having a plaited garland of roses on his head, and
wearing a golden embroidered robe, he would walk about alone, having
stones under his arm, which he would throw at those of his friends who
were following him. And he used to bathe also in the public baths,
anointed all over with perfumes; and, on one occasion, some private
individual, seeing him, said, "You are a happy man, O king; you smell
in a most costly manner:" and he, being much pleased, said, "I will
give you as much as you can desire of this perfume." And so he ordered
an ewer containing more than two choes of thick perfumed unguent to
be poured over his head; so that the multitude of the poorer people
who were about all collected to gather up what was spilt; and, as the
place was made very slippery by it, Antiochus himself slipped and fell,
laughing a great deal, and most of the bathers did the same.</p>

<p>But Polybius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories, calls this
man Epimanes (mad), and not Epiphanes (illustrious), on account of his
actions. "For he not only used to go to entertainments of the common
citizens, but he also would drink with any strangers who happened to be
sojourning in the city, and even with those of the meanest class. And
if," says Polybius, "he heard that any of the younger men were making a
feast anywhere whatever, he would come with an earthen bowl, and with
music, so that the greater part of the feasters fled away alarmed at
his unexpected appearance. And very often he would put off his royal
robes, and take a common cloak, and in that dress go round the market."</p>

<p>53. And in the thirty-first book of his Histories, the same Polybius
tells us "that when Antiochus was celebrating some public games at
Antioch, he invited all the Greeks and any of the multitude who
chose to come to the spectacle. And when a great many people came,
he anointed them all in the gymnasia with ointment of saffron, and
cinnamon, and nard, and amaracus, and lilies, out of golden vessels:
and then, inviting them all to a feast, he filled sometimes a thousand
and sometimes fifteen hundred triclinia with the most expensive

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 694]</span>

preparations; and he himself personally attended to waiting on the
guests. For, standing at the entrance, he introduced some, and others
he placed upon the couches; and he himself marshalled the servants who
brought in the different courses; and, walking about among the guests,
at times he sat down in one place, and at times he lay down in another.
And sometimes he would put down what he was eating, and at other times
he would lay down his cup, and jump up, and change his place, and go
all round the party, standing up himself, and pledging different people
at different times; and then, mingling with the musicians, he would be
brought in by the actors, entirely covered up, and laid down on the
ground, as if he had been one of the actors himself; and then, when
the music gave the signal, the king would leap up, and dance and sport
among the actors, so that they were all ashamed. To such absurdities
does a want of education, when joined with drunkenness, reduce
miserable men." And his namesake, the Antiochus who carried on war in
Media against Arsaces, was very fond of drinking; as Posidonius of
Apamea relates in the sixteenth book of his History. Accordingly, when
he was slain, he says that Arsaces, when he buried him, said&mdash;"Your
courage and your drunkenness have ruined you, O Antiochus; for you
hoped that, in your great cups, you would be able to drink up the
kingdom of Arsaces."</p>

<p>54. But the Antiochus who was surnamed the Great, who was subdued by
the Romans (as Polybius relates in his twentieth book), having arrived
at Chalcis, in Euboea, celebrated a marriage when he was fifty years
of age; and after he had undertaken two most enormous and important
affairs, namely, the liberation of the Greeks (as he himself professed)
and the war against the Romans. At all events, he, being smitten with
love for a damsel of Chalcis, was very anxious to marry her at the very
time that he was engaged in this war, being a man very fond of drinking
and delighting in drunkenness. And she was the daughter of Cleophanes,
one of the nobles, and superior to all the maidens of her country
in beauty. Accordingly, he celebrated his marriage in Chalcis, and
remained there all the winter, not once giving the smallest thought to
the important affairs which he had in hand. And he gave the damsel the
name of Euboea. Accordingly, being defeated</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 695]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DEMETRIUS.</div>

<p>in the war, he fled to Ephesus, with his newly-married bride. And
in the second book, the same Polybius relates that Agron, the king
of the Illyrians, being delighted at having gained a victory over
the haughty &AElig;tolians, being a man much addicted to drinking, and to
drunkenness, and banqueting, fell ill of a pleurisy, and died. And the
same historian says, in his twenty-ninth book, that Genthion, the king
of the Illyrians, on account of his great fondness for drinking, did a
great many intemperate things during his life, being incessantly drunk,
both night and day; and having murdered Pleuratus, his brother, who was
about to marry the daughter of Menunius, he married the damsel himself,
and treated his subjects with great cruelty. And he says, in the
thirty-third book of his History, that Demetrius, when he fled after
having been a hostage at Rome, and became king of the Syrians, became a
great drinker, and was drunk the greater part of the day. And he also,
in his thirty-second book, says that Orophernes, who was for a short
time king of Cappadocia, disregarded all the customs of his country,
and introduced the artificial luxury of the Ionians.</p>

<p>55. On which account, that divinest of writers, Plato, lays down
admirable laws in his second book&mdash;"That boys, till they are eighteen
years of age, should absolutely never taste wine at all; for that it is
not well to heap fire on fire: that men up to thirty years of age may
drink wine in moderation; and that the young man should wholly abstain
from much wine and from drunkenness. But that a man, when he arrives at
forty years of age, may feast in large banquets, and invoke the other
gods, and especially Bacchus, to the feasts and amusements of the older
men; since he it is who has given men this means of indulgence, as an
ally against the austerity of old age, for which wine was the best
medicine; so that, owing to it, we grow young again, and forget our
moroseness." And then he proceeds to say&mdash;"But there is a report and
story told that this god was once deprived of his mind and senses by
his mother-in-law, Juno; on which account he sent Bacchic frenzy, and
all sorts of frantic rage, among men, out of revenge for the treatment
which he had experienced; on which account also he gave wine to men."</p>

<p>56. But Phal&aelig;us, in his Epigrams, makes mention of a woman, whose name
was Cleo, as having been a very hard drinker&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 696]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
Cleo bestow'd this splendid gift on Bacchus,<br />
The tunic, fringed with gold and saffron hues,<br />
Which long she wore herself; so great she was<br />
At feasts and revelry: there was no man<br />
Who could at all contend with her in drinking.
</div>

<p>And it is a well-known fact that all the race of women is fond of
drinking. And it was not without some wit that Xenarchus introduces, in
his Pentathlum, a woman swearing this most horrible oath:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
May it be granted me to pass from life<br />
Drinking abundant draughts of wine, while you,<br />
My darling daughter, live and prosper here.
</div>

<p>But among the Romans, as Polybius says, in his sixth book, it was
forbidden to women to drink wine at all. However, they drink what is
called Passum; and that is made of raisins, and when drank is very like
the sweet &AElig;gosthenite and Cretan wine, on which account men use it
when oppressed by excessive thirst. And it is impossible for a woman
to drink wine without being detected: for, first of all, she has not
the key of the cellar; and, in the next place, she is bound to kiss her
relations, and those of her husband, down to cousins, and to do this
every day when she first sees them; and besides this, she is forced to
be on her best behaviour, as it is quite uncertain whom she may chance
to meet; for if she has merely tasted wine, it needs no informer, but
is sure to betray itself."</p>

<p>And Alcimus the Sicilian, in that book of his which is entitled the
Italian History, says that all the women in Italy avoid drinking wine
on this account: "When Hercules was in the district of the Crotoniat&aelig;,
he one day was very thirsty, and came to a certain house by the wayside
and asked for something to drink; and it happened that the wife of the
master of the house had privily opened a cask of wine, and therefore
she said to her husband that it would be a shameful thing for him to
open this cask for a stranger; and so she bade him give Hercules some
water. But Hercules, who was standing at the door, and heard all this,
praised her husband very much, but advised him to go indoors himself
and look at the cask. And when he had gone in, he found that the cask
had become petrified. And this fact is proved by the conduct of the
women of the country, among whom it is reckoned disgraceful, to this
day, to drink wine, on account of the above-mentioned reason."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 697]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">FEMALE DRINKERS.</div>

<p>57. And what sort of women those among the Greeks are who get drunk,
Antiphanes tells us, in his Female Darter; where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is a certain neighbouring victualler,<br />
And he, whenever I arrive, being thirsty,<br />
Is th' only man who knows the proper way<br />
In which to mix my wine; and makes it not<br />

I recollect that once when I was drinking . . . . .
</div>

<p>And, in his Woman Initiated, (and it is women who are conversing,) he
writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Would you now like, my dearest friend, to drink?</span><br />

<p>And Alexis, in his Female Dancer, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> But women are quite sure to be content</span><br />

<p>And so on. And, in his Jupiter the Mourner, he mentions a certain woman
named Zopyra, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Zopyra, that wine-cask.
</div>

<p>Antiphanes, in his Female Bacchanalians&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But since this now is not the case, I'm sure<br />
He is a wretched man who ever marries<br />

<p>And Xenarchus, in his Pentathlum, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I write a woman's oath in mighty wine.
</div>

<p>58. Plato, in his Phaon, relating how many things happen to women
because of wine, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come now, ye women, long ago have I<br />

<p>And Axionicus says, in his Philinna&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Just trust a woman to drink only water.
</div>

<p>59. And whole nations are mentioned as addicted to drunkenness.
Accordingly, B&aelig;ton, the measurer of distances for Alexander, in his
book which is entitled Stations of the March of Alexander, and Amyntas
also, in his Stations, says that the nation of the Tapyri is so fond
of wine that they never use any other unguent than that. And Ctesias
tells the same story, in his book Concerning the Revenues in Asia. And
he says that they are a most just people. And Harmodius of Lepreum, in
his treatise on the Laws in force among the people of Phigalea, says
that the Phigaleans are addicted to drinking, being neighbours of the
Messenians, and being also a people much accustomed to travelling.
And Phylarchus, in his sixth book, says that the Byzantians are so
exceedingly fond of wine, that they live in the wine-shops and let
out their own houses and their wives also to strangers: and that they
cannot bear to hear the sound of a trumpet even in their sleep. On
which account once, when they were attacked by the enemy, and could not
endure the labour of defending their walls, Leonidas, their general,
ordered the innkeepers' booths to be erected as tents upon the walls,
and even then it was with difficulty that they were stopped from
deserting, as Damon tells us, in his book on Byzantium. But Menander,
in his play called the Woman carrying the Mysterious sacred Vessels of
Minerva, or the Female Flute-player, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Byzantium makes all the merchants drunk.<br />
On your account we drank the whole night long,<br />
And right strong wine too, as it seems to me,&mdash;<br />
At least I got up with four heads, I think.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 699]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE ILLYRIANS.</div>

<p>And the Argives too are ridiculed by the comic poets as addicted to
drunkenness; and so are the Tirynthians by Ephippus, in his Busiris.
And he introduces Hercules as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> For how in the name of all the gods at once,</span><br />
Do you not know me, the Tirynthian Argive?<br />
That race fights all its battles when 'tis drunk.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> And that is why they always run away.</span>
</div>

<p>And Eubulus, in his Man Glued, says that the Milesians are very
insolent when they are drunk. And Polemo, in his treatise on the
Inscriptions to be found in Cities, speaking of the Eleans, produces
this epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Elis is always drunk, and always lying:<br />
As is each single house, so is the city.
</div>

<p>60. And Theopompus, in his twenty-second book, speaking of the
Chalcidians in Thrace, says: "For they disregarded all the most
excellent habits, rushing readily with great eagerness to drinking and
laziness, and every sort of intemperance. And all the Thracians are
addicted to drinking; on which account Callimachus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For he could hardly bear the Thracian way<br />
Of drinking monstrous goblets at one draught;<br />
And always did prefer a smaller cup."
</div>

<p>And, in his fiftieth book, Theopompus makes this statement about the
Methymn&aelig;ans: "And they live on the most sumptuous kind of food, lying
down and drinking&mdash;and never doing anything at all worthy of the
expense that they went to. So Cleomenes the tyrant stopped all this;
he who also ordered the female pimps, who were accustomed to seduce
free-born women, and also three or four of the most nobly born of those
who had been induced to prostitute themselves, to be sewn in sacks
and thrown into the sea." And Hermippus, in his account of the Seven
Wise Men, says Periander did the same thing. But in the second book
of his History of the Exploits of Philip he says, "The Illyrians both
eat and drink in a sitting posture; and they take their wives to their
entertainments; and it is reckoned a decorous custom for the women to
pledge the guests who are present. And they lead home their husbands
from their drinking-parties; and they all live plainly, and when they
drink, they girdle their stomach with broad girdles, and at first they
do so moderately; but when they drink more vehemently, then they keep
contracting their belt. And the Ari&aelig;ans," says he, "have three hundred

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 700]</span>

thousand slaves whom they call prospelat&aelig;, and who correspond to the
Helots; and they get drunk every day, and make large entertainments,
and are very intemperate in their eating and drinking. On which account
the Celt&aelig; when making war upon them, knowing their intemperance,
ordered all the soldiers to prepare as superb a feast as possible in
the tent, and to put in the food some medicinal herbs which had the
power to gripe and purge the bowels exceedingly. And when this had been
done . . . . And so some of them were taken by the Celt&aelig; and put to death,
and some threw themselves into the rivers, being unable to endure the
pains which they were suffering in their stomachs."</p>

<p>61. Now, after Democritus had uttered all this long uninterrupted
discourse, Pontianus said that wine was the metropolis of all these
evils; and it was owing to this that drunkenness, and madness, and all
sorts of debauchery took place; and that those people who were too much
addicted to it were not unappropriately called rowers of cups, by that
Dionysius who is surnamed the Brazen, in his Elegies, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And those who bring their wine in Bacchus' rowing,<br />
Sailors through feasts, and rowers of large cups.
</div>

<p>And concerning this class of men, (for it is not extinct,) Alexis, in
his Curia, speaking of some one who drunk to excess, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This then my son is such in disposition<br />
As you have just beheld him. An &OElig;nopion,<br />
Or Maron, or Capelus, or Timoclees,<br />
For he's a drunkard, nothing more nor less.<br />
And for the other, what can I call him?<br />
A lump of earth, a plough, an earth-born man.
</div>

<p>So getting drunk is a bad thing, my good friends; and the same Alexis
says, with great cleverness, to those who swallow wine in this way, in
his Opora, (and the play is called after a courtesan of that name,)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Are you then full of such a quantity<br />
Of unmix'd wine, and yet avoid to vomit?
</div>

<p>And in his Ring he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Is not, then, drunkenness the greatest evil,<br />
And most injurious to the human race?
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 701]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EVILS OF DRUNKENNESS.</div>

<p>And in his Steward he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For much wine is the cause of many crimes.
</div>

<p>And Crobylus, in his Female Deserter, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What pleasure, prithee tell me, can there be<br />
In getting always drunk? in, while still living,<br />
Yourself depriving thus of all your senses;<br />
The greatest good which nature e'er has given?
</div>

<p>Therefore it is not right to get drunk; for "A city which has been
governed by a democracy," says Plato, in the eighth book of his Polity,
"when it has thirsted for freedom, if it meets with bad cupbearers
to help it, and if, drinking of the desired draught too deeply, it
becomes intoxicated, then punishes its magistrates if they are not very
gentle indeed, and if they do not allow it a great deal of licence,
blaming them as wicked and oligarchical; and those people who obey
the magistrates it insults." And, in the sixth book of his Laws, he
says&mdash;"A city ought to be like a well-mixed goblet, in which the wine
which is poured in rages; but being restrained by the opposite and
sober deity, enters into a good partnership with it, and so produces a
good and moderate drink."</p>

<p>62. For profligate debauchery is engendered by drunkenness. On which
account Antiphanes, in his Arcadia, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For it, O father, never can become<br />
A sober man to seek debauchery,<br />
Nor yet to serious cares to give his mind,<br />
When it is rather time to drink and feast.<br />
But he that cherishes superhuman thoughts,<br />
Trusting to small and miserable riches,<br />
Shall at some future time himself discover<br />
That he is only like his fellow-men,<br />
If he looks, like a doctor, at the tokens,<br />
And sees which way his veins go, up or down,<br />
On which the life of mortal man depends.
</div>

<p>And, in his &AElig;olus, mentioning with indignation the evil deeds which
those who are great drinkers do, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Macareus, when smitten with unholy love<br />
For one of his own sisters, for a while<br />
Repress'd the evil thought, and check'd himself;<br />
But after some short time he wine admitted<br />
To be his general, under whose sole lead<br />
Audacity takes the place of prudent counsel,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 702]</span>

And so by night his purpose he accomplish'd.
</div>

<p>And well, therefore, did Aristophanes term wine the milk of Venus,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And wine, the milk of Venus, sweet to drink;
</div>

<p>because men, after having drunk too much of it, have often conceived a
desire for illicit amours.</p>

<p>63. But Hegesander the Delphian speaks of some men as <ins title="Greek: exoinoi">ἔξοινοι</ins>;
by which term he means, overtaken with wine; speaking thus:&mdash;"Comeon
and Rhodophon being two of the ministers who managed the affairs of
Rhodes, were both drunk; and Comeon attacking Rhodophon as a gambler,
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O you old man, the crew of youthful gamblers<br />
Beyond a doubt are pressing hard upon you.
</div>

<p>And Rhodophon reproached him with his passion for women, and with
his incontinence, abstaining from no sort of abuse." And Theopompus,
in the sixteenth book of his Histories, speaking of another Rhodian,
says&mdash;"When Hegesilochus had become perfectly useless, partly from
drunkenness and gambling, and when he had utterly lost all credit among
the Rhodians, and when instead his whole course of life was found
fault with by his own companions and by the rest of the citizens." . . . . .
Then he goes on to speak of the oligarchy which he established with
his friends, saying&mdash;"And they violated a great number of nobly-born
women, wives of the first men in the state; and they corrupted no small
number of boys and young men; and they carried their profligacy to such
a height that they even ventured to play with one another at dice for
the free-born women, and they made a bargain which of the nobly-born
matrons he who threw the lowest number on the dice should bring to
the winner for the purpose of being ravished; allowing no exception
at all; but the loser was bound to bring her to the place appointed,
in whatever way he could, using persuasion, or even force if that was
necessary. And some of the other Rhodians also played at dice in this
fashion; but the most frequent and open of all the players in this way
was Hegesilochus, who aspired to become the governor of the city."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 703]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EVILS OF DRUNKENNESS.</div>

<p>And Antheas the Lindian, who claimed to be considered a relation
of Cleobulus the philosopher, as Philodemus reports, in his treatise
on the Sminthians in Rhodes, being an oldish man, and very rich,
and being also an accomplished poet, celebrated the festivals in
honour of Bacchus all his life, wearing a dress such as is worn by
the votaries of Bacchus, and maintaining a troop of fellow-revellers.
And he was constantly leading revels both day and night; and he was
the first man who invented that kind of poetry which depends upon
compound words, which Asopodorus the Phliasian afterwards employed in
his conversational Iambics. And he too used to write comedies and many
other pieces in the same style of poetry, which he used to recite to
his phallus-bearers.</p>

<p>64. When Ulpian had heard all this he said,&mdash;Tell me, my good
Pontianus, says he, in what author does the word <ins title="Greek: paroinos">πάροινος</ins>
occur? And he replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You will undo me with your questions . .
</div>

<p>(as the excellent Agatho says)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace11">. . . . and your new fashion,</span><br />
Always talking at an unseasonable time.
</div>

<p>But since it is decided that we are to be responsible to you for every
word, Antiphanes, in his Lydian, has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A Colchian man drunken and quarrelsome (<ins title="Greek: paroinos">πάροινος</ins>).
</div>

<p>But you are not yet satisfied about your <ins title="Greek: paroinoi">πάροινοι</ins>, and
drunkards; nor do you consider that Eumenes the king of Pergamus, the
nephew of Philet&aelig;rus, who had formerly been king of Pergamus, died of
drunkenness, as Ctesicles relates, in the third book of his Times. But,
however, Perseus, whose power was put down by the Romans, did not die
in that way; for he did not imitate his father Philip in anything; for
he was not eager about women, nor was he fond of wine; but when at a
feast he was not only moderate himself, but all his friends who were
with him were so too, as Polybius relates, in his twenty-sixth book.
But you, O Ulpian, are a most immoderate drinker yourself (<ins title="Greek: arrhythmopotês">ἀῤῥυθμοπότης</ins>),
as Timon the Phliasian calls it. For so he called
those men who drink a great quantity of unmixed wine, in the second
book of his Silli&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Or that great ox-goad, harder than Lycurgus's,<br />
Who smote the <ins title="Greek: arrhythmopotai">ἀῤῥυθμόποται</ins> of Bacchus,<br />
And threw their cups and brimming ladles down.
</div>

<p>For I do not call you simply <ins title="Greek: potikos">ποτικὸς</ins>, or fond of drinking; and
this last is a word which Alc&aelig;us has used, in his Ganymede. And that
a habit of getting drunk deceives our eyesight, Anacharsis has shown
plainly enough, in what he says where he shows that mistaken opinions
are taken up by drunken men. For a fellow-drinker of his once, seeing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 704]</span>

his wife at a banquet, said, "O Anacharsis, you have married an ugly
woman." And he replied, "Indeed I think so too, but however now, give
me, O boy, a cup of stronger wine, that I may make her out beautiful."</p>

<p>65. After this Ulpian, pledging one of his companions, said,&mdash;But, my
dear friend, according to Antiphanes, who says, in his Countryman&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg2"><i>A.</i> Shut now your eyes, and drink it all at once.</span><br />

Ulysses,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<div class="blockindent">
Wine, the brave router of all melancholy,
</div>

<p>can never suffer such a mischance as that. But as Aristotle says, in
his book on Drunkenness, they who have drunk beer, which they call
<ins title="Greek: pinos">πῖνος</ins>, fall on their backs. For he says, “But there is a peculiarity
in the effects of the drink made from barley, which they call <ins title="Greek: pinos">πῖνος</ins>,
for they who get drunk on other intoxicating liquors fall on all parts
of their body; they fall on the left side, on the right side, on their
faces, and on their backs. But it is only those who get drunk on beer
who fall on their backs, and lie with their faces upwards.” But the
wine which is made of barley is by some called <ins title="Greek: brytos">βρύτος</ins>, as Sophocles
says, in his Triptolemus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And not to drink the earthy beer (<ins title="Greek: bryton">βρύτον</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Archilochus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And she did vomit wine as any Thracian<br />
Might vomit beer (<ins title="Greek: bryton">βρύτον</ins>), and played the wanton stooping.
</div>

<p>And &AElig;schylus, also, mentions this drink, in his Lycurgus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And after this he drank his beer (<ins title="Greek: bryton">βρύτον</ins>), and much
And loudly bragg'd in that most valiant house.

<p>But Hellanicus, in his Origins, says that beer is made also out of
roots, and he writes thus:&mdash;"But they drink beer (<ins title="Greek: bryton">βρύτον</ins>) made of roots,
as the Thracians drink it made of barley." And Hecat&aelig;us,
in the second book of his Description of the World, speaking of the
Egyptians, and saying that they are great bread-eaters, adds, "They
bruise barley so as to make a drink of it." And, in his Voyage round
Europe, he says that "the P&aelig;onians drink beer made of barley,
and a liquor called <ins title="Greek: parabiê">παραβίη</ins>, made of millet and conyza. And they
anoint themselves," adds he, "with oil made of milk." And this is

<p>69. And when Ulpian was about to add something to this &AElig;milianus
said,—It is time for us, my friends, to inquire in some degree about
<ins title="Greek: griphoi">γρῖφοι</ins>, that we may leave our cups for a little while, not indeed in
the spirit of that work which is entitled the Grammatical Tragedy of
Callias the Athenian: but let us first inquire what is the definition
of what we call a <ins title="Greek: griphos">γρῖφος</ins> . . . . And we may omit what Cleobulina of Lindus
has proposed in her Epigrams; for our companion, Diotimus of Olympia,
has discussed that point sufficiently; but we must consider how the
comic poets have mentioned it, and what punishment those who have
failed to solve it have undergone. And Laurentius said,&mdash;Clearchus
the Solensian defines the word thus: "<ins title="Greek: Griphos">Γρῖφος</ins>," says he, "is a
sportive problem, in which we are bidden to seek out, by the exertion
of our intellect and powers of investigation, what is proposed to us,
which has been uttered for the sake of some honour or some penalty."
And in his discussion on these griphi, the same Clearchus asserts that
"there are seven kinds of griphi. In the letter, when we say that there
is a certain name of a fish or plant, beginning with <ins title="Greek: a">α</ins>. And
similarly, when he who proposes the griphus desires us to mention

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 708]</span>

some name in which some particular letter is or is not. Such are
those which are called sigma-less griphi; on which account Pindar has
composed an ode on the <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins>, as if some griphus had been proposed to
him as a subject for a lyric poem. Then griphi are said to be in the
syllable, when we are desired to recite some verse which begins with
the syllable <ins title="Greek: ba">βα</ins>, as with <ins title="Greek: basileus">βασιλεὺς</ins>, for instance, or which ends with
<ins title="Greek: nax">ναξ</ins>, as <ins title="Greek: Kallianax">Καλλιάναξ</ins>, or some in which the syllables <ins title="Greek: Leôn">Λεων</ins> take the lead,
as <ins title="Greek: Leônidês">Λεωνίδης</ins>, or on the other hand close the sentence, as <ins title="Greek: Thrasyleôn">Θρασυλέων</ins>.
They are in the name, when we utter simple or compound names of two
syllables, by which some tragic figure, or on the other hand some
humble one, is indicated; or some names which have no connexion with
anything divine, as <ins title="Greek: Kleônymos">Κλεώνυμος</ins>, or which have some such connexion, as
<ins title="Greek: Dionysios">Διονύσιος</ins>: and this, too, whether the connexion be with one God or
with more, as <ins title="Greek: Hermaphroditos">῾Eρμαφρόδιτος</ins>; or whether the name begins with Jupiter,
as <ins title="Greek: Dioklês">Διοκλῆς</ins>, or with Mercury, as <ins title="Greek: Hermodôros">Ὲρμόδωρος</ins>; or whether it ends, as it
perhaps may, with <ins title="Greek: nikos">νῖκος</ins>. And then they who were desired to say such
and such things, and could not, had to drain the cup.” And Clearchus
defined the word in this way. And now you, my good friend Ulpian, may
inquire what the cup to be drained is.</p>

<p>70. But concerning these griphi, Antiphanes says, in his Cnoethis, or
the Pot-bellied Man&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I thought before that those who while at meals</span><br />

For we, ten men, contribute now for supper,<br />

<p>73. And in his play called Sappho, Antiphanes represents the poetess
herself as proposing griphi, which we may call riddles, in this manner:
and then some one else is represented as solving them. For she says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>S.</i> There is a female thing which holds her young</span><br />
Safely beneath her bosom; they, though mute,<br />
Cease not to utter a loud-sounding voice<br />
Across the swelling sea, and o'er the land,<br />
Speaking to every mortal that they choose;<br />
But those who present are can nothing hear,<br />
Still they have some sensation of faint sound.
</div>

<p>And some one, solving this riddle, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> The female thing you speak of is a city;</span><br />
The children whom it nourishes, orators;<br />
They, crying out, bring from across the sea,<br />
From Asia and from Thrace, all sorts of presents:<br />
The people still is near them while they feed on it,<br />
And pour reproaches ceaselessly around,<br />
While it nor hears nor sees aught that they do.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>S.</i> But how, my father, tell me, in God's name,</span><br />
Can you e'er say an orator is mute,<br />
Unless, indeed, he's been three times convicted?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> And yet I thought that I did understand</span><br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 712]</span>

The riddle rightly. Tell me then yourself.

<p>And so then he introduces Sappho herself solving the riddle, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>S.</i> The female thing you speak of is a letter,</span><br />
The young she bears about her is the writing:<br />
They're mute themselves, yet speak to those afar off<br />
Whene'er they please. And yet a bystander,<br />
However near he may be, hears no sound<br />
From him who has received and reads the letter.
</div>

<p>74. And Diphilus, in his Theseus, says that there were once three
Samian damsels, who, on the day of the festival of Adonis, used to
delight themselves in solving riddles at their feasts. And that when
some one had proposed to them this riddle, "What is the strongest of
all things?" one said iron, and alleged the following reasons for her
opinion, because that is the instrument with which men dig and cut, and
that is the material which they use for all purposes. And when she had
been applauded, the second damsel said that a blacksmith exerted much
greater strength, for that he, when he was at work, bent this strong
iron, and softened it, and used it for whatever purposes he chose. And
the third said, they were both wrong, and that love was the strongest
thing of all, for that love could subdue a blacksmith.</p>

<p>And Ach&aelig;us the Eretrian, though he is usually a very clear poet as
respects the structure of his poems, sometimes makes his language
obscure, and says many things in an enigmatical style; as, for
instance, in his Iris, which is a satyric play. For he says, "A cruet
of litharge full of ointment was suspended from a Spartan tablet,
written upon and twisted on a double stick;" meaning to say a white
strap, from which a silver cruet was suspended; and he has spoken of
a Spartan written tablet when he merely meant the Spartan scytale.
And that the Laced&aelig;monians put a white strap, on which they wrote
whatever they wished, around the scytale, we are told plainly enough by
Apollonius Rhodius, in his Treatise on Archilochus. And Stesichorus, in
his Helen, speaks of a footpan of litharge; and Ion, in his Phoenix or
C&aelig;neus, calls the birdlime the sweat of the oak, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sweat of oaks, and a long leafy branch<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">RIDDLES.</div>

<p>75. And Hermippus says, that Theodectes of Phaselus, in
his book on the Pupils of Isocrates, was a wonderfully clever man at
discovering any riddles that might be proposed to him, and that he too
could propose riddles to others with great acuteness. As that riddle
about shade, for instance;&mdash;for he said that there was a nature which
is greatest at its birth and at its decease, and least when at its
height. And he speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Of all the things the genial earth produces,<br />
Or the deep sea, there is no single one,<br />
Nor any man or other animal<br />
Whose growth at all can correspond to this:<br />
For when it first is born its size is greatest;<br />
At middle age 'tis scarcely visible,<br />
So small it's grown; but when 'tis old and hastens<br />
Nigh to its end, it then becomes again<br />
Greater than all the objects that surround it.
</div>

<p>And in the &OElig;dipus, which is a tragedy, he speaks of night and day in
the following riddle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There are two sisters, one of whom brings forth<br />
The other, and in turn becomes its daughter.
</div>

<p>And Callisthenes, in his Greek History, tells the following story,
that "when the Arcadians were besieging Cromnus, (and that is a small
town near Megalopolis,) Hippodamus the Laced&aelig;monian, being one of
the besieged persons, gave a message to the herald who came to them
from the Laced&aelig;monians, showing the condition in which they were by
a riddle, and he bade him tell his mother&mdash;'to be sure and release
within the next ten days the little woman who was bound in the temple
of Apollo; as it would not be possible to release her if they let those
days elapse.' And by this message he plainly enough intimated what he
was desirous to have understood; for the little woman meant is Famine,
of which there was a picture in the temple of Apollo, near the throne
of Apollo, and it was represented under a woman's form; so it was
evident to every one that those who were besieged could hold out only
ten days more because of famine. So the Laced&aelig;monians, understanding
the meaning of what had been said, brought succour with great speed to
the men in Cromnus."</p>

<p>76. There are also many other riddles, such as this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I saw a man who by the means of fire<br />
Was glueing brass unto another man<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 714]</span>

So closely that they two became like brothers.
</div>

And this expression means the application of a cupping-glass. And a
similar one is that of Panarces, mentioned by Clearchus, in his Essay
on Griphi, that "A man who is not a man, with a stone which was not a
stone, struck a bird which was not a bird, sitting on a tree which was
not a tree." For the things alluded to here are a eunuch, a piece of
pumice-stone, a bat, and a narthex<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. And Plato, in the fifth book
of his Laws,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> alludes to this riddle, where he says, that those
philosophers who occupy themselves about minute arts, are like those
who, at banquets, doubt what to eat, and resemble too the boys' riddle
about the stone thrown by the eunuch, and about the bat, and about the
place from which they say that the eunuch struck down the bat, and the
engine with which he did it.

<p>77. And of this sort also are those enigmatical sayings of Pythagoras,
as Demetrius of Byzantium says, in the fourth book of his treatise on
Poets, where, for instance, he says, "A man should not eat his heart;"
meaning, "a man should cultivate cheerfulness." "One should not stir
the fire with a sword;" meaning, "one should not provoke an angry man;"
for anger is fire, and quarrelsomeness is a sword. "One should not
step over a yoke;" meaning, "one should avoid and hate all kinds of
covetousness, but seek equality." "One should not travel along the high
road;" meaning, "one should not follow the opinions of the multitude,
(for the common people approve of whatever they take in their heads
without any fixed principle,) but one should rather go on the straight
road, using sense as one's guide." "One should not sit down upon a
bushel;" meaning, "one should not be content with merely considering
what is sufficient for the present day, but one should always have an
eye to the future" * * * * * * * * *<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> "For death is the boundary and
limit of life;" and this saying is meant to forbid us approaching the
subject with anxiety and grief.</p>

<p>78. And Dromeas the Coan used to play at riddles in
much the same way as Theodectes, according to the statement of
Clearchus: and so did Aristonymus, the player on the harp, without any
vocal accompaniment: and so did that Cleon who was surnamed Mimaulus,
who was the best actor of Italian mimes that ever appeared on the
stage without a mask. For in the style of play which I have mentioned
already, he was superior even to Nymphodorus. And Ischomachus the
herald was an imitator of his, who used to give his representations in
the middle of a crowd, and after he had become celebrated, he altered
his style and used to act mimes at the jugglers' shows. And the riddles
which these men used to propose were of the following kind:&mdash;A clown
once had eaten too much, and was very unwell, and when the physician
asked him whether he had eaten to vomit, No, said he, but I ate to my
stomach. And another was,&mdash;A poor woman had a pain in her stomach,
and when the physician asked her whether she had anything<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in her
stomach, How should I, said she, when I have eaten nothing for three
days?</p>

<p>And the writings of Aristonymus were full of pompous expressions: and
Sosiphanes the poet said to Cephisocles the actor, reproaching him as
a man fond of long words, "I would throw a stone at your loins, if I
were not afraid of wetting the bystanders." But the logical griphus is
the oldest kind, and the one most suited to the natural character of
such enigmatical language. "What do we all teach when we do not know it
ourselves?" and, "What is the same nowhere and everywhere?" and also,
"What is the same in the heavens and on the earth and in the sea?"
But this is a riddle arising from an identity of name; for there is a
bear, and a serpent, and an eagle, and a dog, both in the heavens and
on the earth and in the sea. And the other riddle means Time; for that
is the same to all people and everywhere, because it has not its nature
depending on one place. And the first riddle means "How to live:" for
though no one knows this himself, he teaches his neighbour.</p>

<p>79. And Callias the Athenian, whom we were discussing just now, and
who was a little before Strattis in point of time, wrote a play which
he called Grammatical Science; and the plot of it was as follows. The
prologue consists of the elements, and the actor should recite it,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 716]</span>

dividing it into paragraphs, and making the termination in the manner
of a dramatic catastrophe, into "Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, eta, theta.
For <ins title="Greek: ei">ει</ins> is sacred to the God; iota, cappa, lambda, mu, nu, xu,
the diphthong ou, pi, rho, sigma, tau, the present <ins title="Greek: u">υ</ins>, phi,
chi, which is next to psi, all down to omega." And the chorus consisted
of women, in pairs, made of two elements taken together, composed in
metre and lyrical odes in this fashion;&mdash;"Beta alpha ba, beta ei be,
beta eta be, beta iota bi, beta ou bo, beta upsilon bu, beta omega
bo." And then, again, in the antistrophe of the ode and of the metre,
"Gamma alpha, gamma ei, gamma eta, gamma iota, gamma omicron, gamma
upsilon, gamma omega." And in the same way he dealt with all other
syllables&mdash;all which have the same melody and the same metre in the
antistrophes. So that people not only suspect that Euripides drew all
his Medea from this drama, but they think that it is perfectly plain
that he drew the system of his choruses from it. And they say that
Sophocles, after he had heard this drama, endeavoured to divide his
poem in respect of the metre, and did it thus, in the &OElig;dipus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I shall not grieve myself nor you,<br />
Being convicted of this action.
</div>

<p>On which account, all the rest admitted the system of antistrophes from
his example, as it should seem, into their tragedies. Then, after this
chorus, Callias introduces another speech of vowels, in this manner:
(and this also the reciter must divide into paragraphs in the same way
as the previous portions, in order that that delivery may be preserved
which the author originally intended)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Alpha alone, O woman; then one should<br />
Say Ει alone in the second place: next,<br />
Still by itself you will say, thirdly, Eta;<br />
Fourth, still alone, Iota; fifthly, Ou.<br />
In the sixth place, Upsilon by itself.<br />
The last of all the seven vowels is<br />
The slow-paced Omega. The seven vowels<br />
In seven verses; and when you've recited<br />
All these, then go and ponder by yourself.
</div>

<p>80. Callias was also the first man who taught the elements of learning
by iambics, in a licentious sort of language, described in the
following manner&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 717]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">EURIPIDES.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
For I'm in labour, ladies; but from shame,<br />
I will, my dear, in separate lines and letters,<br />
Tell you the name of the child. There is a line<br />
Upright and long; and from the middle of it<br />
There juts forth on each side a little one,<br />
With upward look: and next a circle comes,<br />
On two short feet supported.
</div>

<p>And afterwards, following this example, as any one may suspect,
M&aelig;andrius the prose writer, turning away a little from the usual
pronunciation in his descriptions, wrote those things which are found
in his Precepts, in a less polished style than the above-mentioned
Callias. And Euripides appears to have followed the same model when he
composed those verses, in his Theseus, in which the elements of writing
are described. But the character is an illiterate shepherd, who is
showing that the name of Theseus is inscribed in the place in this way&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For I indeed do nothing know of letters,<br />
But I will tell you all their shapes, and give<br />
Clear indications by which you may judge.<br />
There is a circle, round as though 't had been<br />
Work'd in a lathe, and in its centre space<br />
It has a visible sign. Then the second<br />
Has first of all two lines, and these are parted<br />
By one which cuts them both across the middle.<br />
The third's a curly figure, wreathed round.<br />
The fourth contains one line which mounts right up,<br />
And in a transverse course three others hang<br />
From its right side. The letter which comes fifth<br />
Admits of no such easy explanation;<br />
For there are two diverging lines above,<br />
Which meet in one united line below.<br />
The letter which comes last is like the third.
</div>

<p>[So as to make Θ Ε Σ Ε Υ Σ]</p>

<p>And Agathon the tragic poet has composed a similar passage, in his
Telephus; for there also some illiterate man explains the way of
spelling Theseus thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The letter which comes first is like a circle,<br />
Divided by a navel in the middle;<br />
Then come two upright lines well join'd together;<br />
The third is something like a Scythian bow:<br />
Next comes a trident placed upon its side;<br />
And two lines branching from one lower stem:<br />
The last again the same is as the third.
</div>

<p>And Theodectes of Phaselus introduces an illiterate clown, who also
represents the name of Theseus in his own way&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 718]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
The letter which comes first a circle is,<br />
With one soft eye; then come two upright lines<br />
Of equal and exact proportions,<br />

The third is like a wreathed curl of hair;<br />
The next a trident lying on its side;<br />
The fifth two lines of equal length above,<br />
Which below join together in one base;<br />
The sixth, as I have said before, a curl.

<p>And Sophocles has said something like this, in his Amphiaraus, which is
a satyric drama, where he introduces an actor dancing in unison with
his explanation of the letters.</p>

<p>81. But Neoptolemus the Parian, in his treatise on Inscriptions, says
that this inscription is engraved on the tomb of Thrasymachus the
sophist at Chalcedon&mdash;</p>

<p>And there is a poem of this kind upon Pan, by Castorion the Solensian,
as Clearchus says: every foot<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
consists of one entire word, and so every line has its feet in
pairs, so that they may either precede or follow each other; as for
instance&mdash;</p>

<p>And so on in the same manner. And in whatever order you place each
of these pairs of feet it will give the same metre; as you may, for
instance, transpose the first line, and instead of&mdash;</p>

<p>82. But Pindar, with reference to the ode which was composed without a
σ in it, as the same Clearchus tells us, as if some griphus
had been proposed to him to be expressed in a lyric ode,&mdash;as many were
offended because they considered it impossible to abstain from the
σ, and because they did not approve of the way in which the
idea was executed, uttered this sentence&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Before long series of songs were heard,<br />
And the ill-sounding san from out men's mouths.
</div>

<p>And we may make use of this observation in opposition to those who
pronounce the sigma-less ode of Lasus of Hermione to be spurious, which
is entitled The Centaurs. And the ode which was composed by Lasus to
the Ceres in Hermione, has not a <ins title="Greek: s">σ</ins> in it, as Heraclides of
Pontus says, in the third book of his treatise on Music, which begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I sing of Ceres and her daughter fair,<br />
The bride of Clymenus.
</div>

<p>83. And there are great numbers of other griphi. Here is one&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In a conspicuous land I had my birth,<br />
The briny ocean girds my country round,<br />
My mother is the daughter fair of Number.
</div>

<p>By the conspicuous land (<ins title="Greek: phanera">φανερὰ</ins>) he means Delos (as <ins title="Greek: dêlos">δῆλος</ins> is
synonymous with <ins title="Greek: phaneros">φανερὸς</ins>), and that is an island surrounded by the sea.
And the mother meant is Latona, who is the daughter of Coius, and
the Macedonians use <ins title="Greek: koios">κοῖος</ins> as synonymous with <ins title="Greek: arithmos">ἀριθμός</ins>. And the one on
barley-water (<ins title="Greek: ptisanê">πτυσάνη</ins>)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
 Mix the juice of peel'd barley, and then drink it.
</div>

<p>And the name <ins title="Greek: ptisanê">πτισάνη</ins> is derived from the verbs <ins title="Greek: ptissô">πτίσσω</ins>, to
pound, and <ins title="Greek: anô">ἄνω</ins>, to bruise. There is also the one

<div class="blockindent">
An animal destitute of feet and spine<br />

<p>And Antiphanes, in the Man who admires himself, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Coagulated, tender-bodied milk.<br />

<p>And Anaxandrides, in his Ugly Woman, says&mdash;</p>

<p>And Plato, in his Adonis, saying that an oracle was given to Cinyras
concerning his son Adonis, reports it in these words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

Your son is far the fairest of all men,<br />

</div>

<p>He means Venus and Bacchus; for both of them loved Adonis. And the
enigma of the Sphinx is reported by Asclepiades, in his essay on the
Subjects on which Tragedies have been written, to have been such as
this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is upon the earth an animal<br />
With two feet, and with four, and eke with three,<br />
And with one voice; and it alone, of all<br />

Then is its speed the slowest, and strength least.

<p>84. And there are also some sayings partaking of the character of
griphi, composed by Simonides, as is reported by Cham&aelig;leon of Heraclea,
in his treatise on the Life and Writings of Simonides&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 721]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ENIGMATICAL SAYINGS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
The father of a kid which roves for food,<br />
And a sad fish, had their heads near together;<br />
And when they had received beneath their eyelids<br />
The son of Night, they did not choose to cherish<br />
The bull-slaying servant of the sovereign Bacchus.
</div>

<p>But some say that these verses were inscribed on some one of the
ancient offerings which were dedicated at Chalcis; and that on it were
represented the figures of a goat and a dolphin; to which animals
allusion is made in the above lines. And others say that a dolphin and
a goat were embossed in that part of a psaltery where the strings are
put in, and that they are what is meant here; and that the bull-slaying
servant of Bacchus is the dithyrambic. And others say that the ox which
is sacrificed to Bacchus in the town of Iulis is struck with an axe by
some one of the young men: and that the festival being near, the axe
had been sent to a forge, and Simonides, being then a young man, went
to the smith to fetch it; and that when he found the man asleep, and
his bellows and his tongs lying loosely about with their fore parts
touching one another, he then came back, and told the before-mentioned
problem to his friends. For the father of a kid he called the bellows,
and the sad fish the tongs (which is called <ins title="Greek: karkinos">καρκῖνος</ins>, or the crab).
The son of Night is sleep, and the bull-slaying servant of
Bacchus is the axe. And Simonides composed also another epigram which
causes perplexity to those who are ignorant of history&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I say that he who does not like to win<br />
The grasshopper's prize, will give a mighty feast<br />
To the Panopeiadean Epeus.
</div>

<p>And it is said, that when he was sojourning at Carthea he used to train
choruses; and that the place where these exercises took place was in
the upper part of the city, near the temple of Apollo, a long way from
the sea; so that all the rest of the citizens, and Simonides himself,
went down to get water, to a place where there was a fountain; and that
an ass, whose name was Epeus, used to carry the water up for them; and
they gave him this name, because there was a fable that Epeus himself
used to do this; and there was also represented in a picture, in the
temple of Apollo, the Trojan fable, in which Epeus is represented as
drawing water for the Atrid&aelig;; as Stesichorus also relates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For the great daughter of Jove pitied him<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 722]</span>

Bearing incessant water for the kings.
</div>

<p>And as this was the case, they say that it was a burden imposed on
every member of the choruses who was not present at the appointed
time, that he should give the ass a ch&oelig;nix of barley; and that this
is stated by the same poet; and that what is meant by not liking
to win the grasshopper's prize, is not liking to sing; and that by
Panopeiadean is meant the ass, and the mighty feast is the ch&oelig;nix of
barley.</p>

<p>85. And of the same kind is the epigram of Theognis the poet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For a sea-corpse has call'd me now back home,<br />
Which, though dead, speaketh with a living mouth.
</div>

<p>Where he means the cockle. And we may consider of the same character
those sentences in which we use words which resemble men's names, as&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
λαβὼν ἀριστόνικον ἐν μάχῃ κράτος:<br />
He gain'd in battle a glorious victory;
</div>

<p>where ἀριστόνικος sounds like the name of a man, Aristonicus.
And there is also that riddle which is so frequently repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Five men came to one place in vessels ten,<br />
And fought with stones, but might not lift a stone,<br />
And died of thirst while water reach'd their chins.
</div>

<p>86. And what punishment had the Athenians who could not solve this
riddle when proposed to them, if it was only to drink a bowl of mixed
wine, as Clearchus has stated in his Definition? And, in the first
book of his treatise on Proverbs, he writes thus&mdash;"The investigation
of riddles is not unconnected with philosophy; for the ancients used
to make a display of their erudition by such things; for they used
at their entertainments to ask questions, not such as the men of the
present day ask one another, as to what sort of amorous enjoyment is
the most delicious, or what kind of fish is nicest, or what is most in
season at the moment; or again, what fish is best to eat at the time of
Arcturus, or what after the rising of the Pleiades, or of the Dog-star.
And then they offer kisses as prizes for those who gain the victory in
such questions; such as are hateful to men of liberal sentiments; and
as a punishment for those who are defeated they enjoin them to drink
sheer wine; which they drink more willingly than the cup of health. For
these things are well adapted to any one who has devoted his attention
to the writings of Phil&aelig;nis and Archestratus, or who has studied the
books called Gastrologies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 723]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">CAPPING VERSES.</div>

<p>They preferred such plays as these;&mdash;when the first person had recited
a verse, the others were bound to quote the verse following; or if
any one had quoted a sentence from some poet, the rest were bound to
produce a sentence from some other poet expressing the same sentiments.
After that, every one was bound to repeat an iambic. And then, each
person was to repeat a line of such and such a number of syllables
precisely; and so on with everything that related to any acquaintance
with letters and syllables. And in a similar manner they would be bound
to repeat the names of all the commanders in the army which attacked
Troy, or of all the Trojan leaders: or to tell the name of some city
in Asia beginning with a given letter; and then the next person was to
tell the name of a city in Europe: and then they were to go through
the rest according as they were desired to give the names of Grecian
or barbarian cities; so that this sport, not being an inconsiderate
one, was a sort of exhibition of the ability and learning of each
individual. And the prizes given were a garland and applause, things by
which love for one another is especially sweetened."</p>

<p>87. This, then, was what Clearchus said; and the things which he says
one ought to propose, are, I imagine, such as these. For one person to
quote a line in Homer beginning with Alpha, and ending with the same
letter, such as&mdash;</p>

<p>88. And since we have made a pretty long digression about griphi, we
must now say what punishment those people underwent who failed to solve
the griphus which was proposed to them. They drank brine mingled with
their drink, and were bound to drink the whole cup up at one draught;
as Antiphanes shows in his Ganymede, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote-left"><ins title="Greek: GRIPHOI">ΓΡΙΦΟΙ</ins>.</div>

The cottabus was a Sicilian game, much in vogue at the
drinking-parties of young men in Athens. The simplest mode was when
each threw the wine left in his cup so as to strike smartly in a metal
basin, at the same time invoking his mistress's name. If all fell in
the basin, and the sound was clear, it was a sign that he stood well
with her. The basin was called <ins title="Greek: kottabeion">κοτταβεῖον</ins>, the action of
throwing <ins title="Greek: apokottabizein">ἀποκοτταβίζειν</ins>, and the wine thrown <ins title="Greek: latages">λάταγες</ins>,
or <ins title="Greek: latagê">λαταγή</ins>. The game afterwards became more complicated, and
was played in various ways; sometimes a number of little cups (<ins title="Greek: oxybapha">ὀξύβαφα</ins>)
were set floating, and he who threw his cottabus so as to
upset the greatest number, in a given number of throws, won the prize,
which was also called <ins title="Greek: kottabeion">κοτταβεῖον</ins>. Sometimes the wine was thrown upon a

Schlegel gives a very different interpretation to this story. He
says&mdash;"In &AElig;schylus the tragic style is as yet imperfect,
and not unfrequently runs into either unmixed epic or lyric. It is
often abrupt, irregular, and harsh. To compose more regular and skilful
tragedies than those of &AElig;schylus was by no means difficult;
but in the more than mortal grandeur which he displayed, it was
impossible that he should ever be surpassed, and even Sophocles, his
younger and more fortunate rival, did not in this respect equal him.
The latter, in speaking of &AElig;schylus, gave a proof that he was
himself a thoughtful artist;&mdash;'&AElig;schylus does what is right,
without knowing it.' These few simple words, exhaust the whole of
what we understand by the phrase, powerful working unconsciously."
This is the comment of a man of real sense, learning, taste, and
judgment.&mdash;<i>Dramatic Literature</i>, p. 95. (Bohn's Standard
Library.)</p></div>

<p>as Cephisodorus the comic poet says, my good friend Timocrates; for
when we were all met together at a convenient season, and with serious
minds, to discuss the goblets, Ulpian, while every one was sitting
still, and before any one began to speak at all, said,&mdash;At the court
of Adrastus, my friends, the chief men of the nation sup while sitting
down. But Polyidus, while sacrificing on the road, detained Peteos as
he was passing by, and while lying on the grass, strewing some leaves
which he had broken off on the ground by way of a table, set before him
some part of the victim which he had sacrificed. And when Autolycus had
come to the rich people of Ithaca, and while he was sitting down, (for

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 726]</span>

the men of that time ate their meals while sitting down,) the nurse
took Ulysses, (as the poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

</div>

<p>and placed him on his knees, not near his knees. So let us not waste
time now, but let us lie down, that Plutarch may lead the way in the
lecture which he promised us on the subject of goblets, and that he may
pledge us all in bumpers.</p>

<p>2.But I imagine that Simonides of Amorgos is the first poet who has
spoken of drinking-cups (<ins title="Greek: potêria">ποτήρια</ins>) by name in his iambics, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cups away did lead him from the table.
</div>

<p>And the author of the poem called the Alcm&aelig;onis says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He placed the corpses lowly on the shore<br />
On a broad couch of leaves; and by their side<br />
A dainty feast he spread, and brimming cups,<br />
And garlands on their noble temples wreathed.

<p>And the word <ins title="Greek: potêrion">ποτήριον</ins> comes from <ins title="Greek: posis">πόσις</ins>, drink, as the Attic word <ins title="Greek: ekpôma">ἔκπωμα</ins>
also does; but they form the word with <ins title="Greek: ô">ω</ins>, as they also say <ins title="Greek: hydropôteô">ὑδροπωτέω</ins>,
to drink water, and <ins title="Greek: oinopôteô">οἰνοπωτέω</ins>, to drink wine. Aristophanes, in his
Knights, says&mdash;</p>

to make a catalogue of the cups of which this sideboard (<ins title="Greek: kylikeion">κυλικεῖον</ins>)

<p>4. It is worth while, I say, to inquire whether the ancients drank out
of large cups. For Dic&aelig;archus the Messenian, the pupil of Aristotle,
in his Essay on Alc&aelig;us, says that they used small cups, and that they
drank their wine mixed with a good deal of water. But Cham&aelig;leon of
Heraclea, in his essay on Drunkenness, (if I only recollect his words
correctly,) says&mdash;"But if those who are in power and who are rich
prefer this drunkenness to other pleasures, it is no great wonder,
for as they have no other pleasure superior to this, nor more easy to
obtain, they naturally fly to wine: on which account it has become
customary among the nobles to use large drinking-cups. For this is not
at all an ancient custom among the Greeks; but one that has been lately
adopted, and imported from the barbarians. For they, being destitute
of education, rush eagerly to much wine, and provide themselves with
all kinds of superfluous delicacies. But in the various countries of
Greece, we neither find in pictures nor in poems any trace of any
cups of large size being made, except indeed in the heroic times. For
the cup which is called <ins title="Greek: rhyton">ῥυτὸν</ins> they attributed only to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 728]</span>

heroes, which fact will appear a perplexing one to some people; unless
indeed any one should choose to say that this custom was introduced
because of the fierceness of the appearance of these demigods. For
they think the heroes irascible and quarrelsome, and more so by night
than by day. In order, then, that they may appear to be so, not
in consequence of their natural disposition, but because of their
propensity for drinking, they represent them as drinking out of large
cups. And it appears to me not to have been a bad idea on the part of
those people who said that a large cup was a silver well."</p>

<p>In all this Cham&aelig;leon appears to be ignorant that it is not a small
cup which in Homer is given to the Cyclops by Ulysses; for if it had
been a small one, he would not have been so overcome with drunkenness
after drinking it three times only, when he was a man of such a
monstrous size. There were therefore large cups at that time; unless
any one chooses to impute it to the strength of the wine, which Homer
himself has mentioned, or to the little practice which the Cyclops had
in drinking, since his usual beverage was milk; or perhaps it was a
barbaric cup, since it was a big one, forming perhaps a part of the
plunder of the Cicones. What then are we to say about Nestor's cup,
which a young man would scarcely have had strength enough to carry,
but which the aged Nestor lifted without any labour; concerning which
identical cup Plutarch shall give us some information. However, it is
time now to lie down at table.</p>

<p>5. And when they had all laid themselves down;&mdash;But, said Plutarch,
according to the Phliasian poet Pratinas&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Not ploughing ready-furrow'd ground,<br />
But, seeking for a goblet,<br />
I come to speak about the cups (<ins title="Greek: kylikêgorêsôn">κυλικηγορήσων</ins>)
</div>

<p>Nor indeed am I one of those <ins title="Greek: kylikranoi">κυλίκρανοι</ins> whom Hermippus, the
comic poet, ridicules in his iambics, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>But these are Heracleans who live at the foot of Mount &OElig;ta, as
Nicander of Thyatira says; saying that they are so named from a certain
Cylix, a Lydian by birth, who was one of the comrades of Hercules. And
they are mentioned also by Scythinus the Teian, in his work entitled
The History,
where he says, "Hercules, having taking Eurytus and his son, put them
to death for exacting tribute from the people of Euboea. And he laid
waste the territory of the Cylicranes for behaving like robbers; and
there he built a city called Heraclea of Trachis." And Polemo, in the
first of his books, addressed to Ad&aelig;us and Antigonus, speaks thus&mdash;"But
the inhabitants of the Heraclea which is at the foot of Mount &OElig;ta,
and of Trachis, are partly some Cylicranes who came with Hercules from
Lydia, and partly Athamanes, some of whose towns remain to this day.
And the people of Heraclea did not admit them to any of the privileges
of citizenship, considering them only as foreigners sojourning amongst
them; and they were called Cylicranes, because they had the figure of a
cup (<ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>) branded on their shoulders."</p>

<p>6. I am aware, too, that Hellanicus says, in his treatise on the Names
of Races, that "Some of the Libyan nomades have no other possessions
than a cup, and a sword, and a ewer, and they have small houses made
of the stalks of asphodel, merely just to serve as a shade, and they
even carry them about with them wherever they go." There is also a
spot amongst the Illyrians, which has been celebrated by many people,
which is called <ins title="Greek: Phylarchus">Κύλικες</ins>, near to which is the tomb of Cadmus
and Harmonia, as Phylarchus relates in the twenty-second book of his
Histories. And Polemo, in his book on Morychus, says that at Syracuse,
on the highest spot of the part called the Island, there is an altar
near the temple of Olympia, outside the walls, from which he says
that people when putting to sea carry a goblet with them, keeping it
until they get to such a distance that the shield in the temple of
Minerva cannot be seen; and then they let it fall into the sea, being
an earthenware cup, putting into it flowers and honeycombs, and uncut
frankincense, and all sorts of other spices besides.</p>

<p>7. And since I now see your banquet, as Xenophanes the Colophonian
says, full of all kinds of pleasure&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For now the floor and all men's hands are clean,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And all the cups, and since the feasters' brows</span><br />

<p>9. On which account, when we are met together in these Dionysiac
conversaziones, no one, as is said in the Tarentines of Alexis&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No one can find a just pretence to grudge us<br />
Our harmless pleasure, since we never injure<br />
One of our neighbours. Know you not, my friend,<br />
That what is called life is but a name,<br />

<p>10. And we may add to all this, that different cities have peculiar
fashions of drinking and pledging one another; as Critias mentions,
in his Constitution of the Laced&aelig;monians, where he says&mdash;"The Chian
and the Thasian drink out of large cups, passing them on towards the
right hand; and the Athenian also passes the wine round towards the
right, but drinks out of small cups. But the Thessalian uses large
cups, pledging whoever he pleases, without reference to where he may
be; but among the Laced&aelig;monians, every one drinks out of his own cup,
and a slave, acting as cupbearer, fills up again the cup when each has
drained it." And Anaxandrides also mentions the fashion of passing
the cup round towards the right hand, in his Countrymen, speaking as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> In what way are you now prepared to drink?</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Shall we then now, my father, tell the guests</span><br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 732]</span>

That would be just as though this were a funeral.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
</div>

<p>11. But we may decline entering on the subject of goblets of
earthenware; for Ctesias says&mdash;"Among the Persians, that man only uses
an earthenware who is dishonoured by the king." And Choerilus the epic
poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Here in my hands I hold a wretched piece<br />
Of earthen goblet, broken all around,<br />
Sad relic of a band of merry feasters;<br />
And often the fierce gale of wanton Bacchus<br />
Dashes such wrecks with insult on the shore.
</div>

<p>But I am well aware that earthenware cups are often very pleasant, as
those which are imported among us from Coptus; for they are made of
earth which is mixed up with spices. And Aristotle, in his treatise on
Drunkenness, says&mdash;"The cups which are called Rhodiacan are brought
into drinking-parties, because of the pleasure which they afford, and
also because, when they are warmed, they deprive the wine of some of
its intoxicating properties; for they are filled with myrrh and rushes,
and other things of the same sort, put into water and then boiled;
and when this mixture is put into the wine, the drinkers are less apt
to become intoxicated." And in another place he says&mdash;"The Rhodiacan
cups consist of myrrh, flowery rushes, saffron, balsam, spikenard, and
cinnamon, all boiled together; and when some of this compound is added
to the wine, it has such effect in preventing intoxication, that it
even diminishes the amorous propensities, checking the breath in some
degree."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 733]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">ATHENIAN BANQUETS.</div>

<p>12. We ought not, then, to drink madly, looking at the multitude of
these beautiful cups, made as they are with every sort of various art,
in various countries. "But the common people," says Chrysippus, in the
introduction to his treatise on what is Good and Evil, "apply the term
madly to a great number of things; and so they call a desire for women
<ins title="Greek: gynaikomania">γυναικομανία</ins>, a fondness for quails <ins title="Greek: ortygomania">ὀρτυγομανία</ins>; and some also call
those who are very anxious for fame <ins title="Greek: doxomaneis">δοξομανεῖς</ins>; just as they call those
who are fond of women <ins title="Greek: gynaikomaneis">γυναικομανεῖ</ins>ς, and those who are fond of birds
<ins title="Greek: ornithomaneis">ὀρνιθομανεῖς</ins>: all these nouns having the same notion of a propensity
to the degree of madness. So that there is nothing inconsistent in
other feelings and circumstances having this name applied to them; as
a person who is very fond of delicacies, and who is properly called
<ins title="Greek: philopsos">φίλοψος</ins> and <ins title="Greek: opsophagos">ὀψοφάγος</ins>, may be called <ins title="Greek: opsomanês">ὀψομανής</ins>; and a man very fond of
wine maybe called <ins title="Greek: oinomanês">οἰνομανής</ins>; and so in similar instances. And there is
nothing unreasonable in attributing madness to such people, since they
carry their errors to a very mad pitch, and wander a great distance
from the real truth.</p>

<p>13. Let us, then, as was the custom among the Athenians, drink
our wine while listening to these jesters and buffoons, and to other
artists of the same kind. And Philochorus speaks of this kind of people
in these terms&mdash;"The Athenians, in the festivals of Bacchus,
originally used to go to the spectacle after they had dined and drunk
their wine; and they used to witness the games with garlands on their
heads. But during the whole time that the games were going on, wine
was continually being offered to them, and sweetmeats were constantly
being brought round; and when the choruses entered, they were offered
wine; and also when the exhibition was over, and they were departing,
wine was offered to them again. And Pherecrates the comic poet bears
witness to all these things, and to the fact that down to his own time
the spectators were never left without refreshment." And Phanodemus
says&mdash;"At the temple of Bacchus, which is in the Marshes (<ins title="Greek: en Limnais">ἐν
Λίμναις</ins>), the Athenians bring wine, and mix it out of the cask for
the god, and then drink of it themselves; on which account Bacchus is
also called <ins title="Greek: Limnaios">Λιμναῖος</ins>,because the wine was first drunk at that festival
mixed with water. On which account the fountains were called Nymphs and
the Nurses of Bacchus, because the water being mingled with the wine
increases the quantity of the wine.</p>

<p>Accordingly, men being delighted with this mixture, celebrated Bacchus
in their songs, dancing and invoking him under the names of Euanthes,
and Dithyrambus, and Baccheutes, and Bromius." And Theophrastus, in his
treatise on Drunkenness, says&mdash;"The nymphs are really the nurses of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 734]</span>

Bacchus; for the vines, when cut, pour forth a great deal of moisture,
and after their own nature weep." On which account Euripides says that
one of the Horses of the Sun is</p>

<div class="blockindent">
&AElig;thops, who with his fervent heat doth ripen<br />

<p>And Ulysses gave</p>

<div class="blockindent">

</div>

<p>And Timotheus, in his Cyclops, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He fill'd one cup, of well-turn'd iv'ry made,<br />

<p>14. And I know, my messmates, of some men who were proud, not so much
of their wealth in money as of the possession of many cups of silver
and gold; one of whom is Pytheas the Arcadian, of the town of Phigalea,
who, even when dying, did not hesitate to enjoin his servants to
inscribe the following verses on his tomb:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This is the tomb of Pytheas, a man<br />
<span class="linespace1">Both wise and good, the fortunate possessor</span><br />
Of a most countless number of fine cups,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Of silver made, and gold, and brilliant amber.</span><br />
These were his treasures, and of them he had<br />
<span class="linespace1">A store, surpassing all who lived before him.</span>
</div>

<p>And Harmodius the Lepreatian mentions this fact in his treatise on
the Laws and Customs subsisting in Phigalea. And Xenophon, in the
eighth book of his Cyrop&aelig;dia, speaking of the Persians, writes as
follows&mdash;"And also they pride themselves exceedingly on the possession
of as many goblets as possible; and even if they have acquired them
by notorious malpractices, they are not at all ashamed of so doing;
for injustice and covetousness are carried on to a great degree among
them." But &OElig;dipus cursed his sons on account of some drinking-cups (as
the author of the Cyclic poem called the Thebaïs says), because they set
before him a goblet which he had forbidden; speaking as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 735]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
But the divine, the golden-hair'd hero,<br />

Up to the brim with sweet and fragrant wine;<br />
But &OElig;dipus, when with angry eyes he saw<br />

<p>15. And C&aelig;cilius the orator who came from Cale Acte, in his treatise
on History, says that Agathocles the Great, when displaying his golden
drinking-cups to his companions, said that he had got all these from
the earthenware cups which he had previously made. And in Sophocles,
in the Lariss&aelig;ans, Acrisius had a great many drinking-cups; where the
tragedian speaks as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And he proclaims to strangers from all quarters<br />
A mighty contest, promising among them<br />
Goblets well wrought in brass, and beauteous vases<br />

</div>

<p>And Posidonius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories, says that
Lysimachus the Babylonian, having invited Himerus to a banquet (who
was tyrant not only over the people of Babylon, but also over the
citizens of Seleucia), with three hundred of his companions, after
the tables were removed, gave every one of the three hundred a silver
cup, weighing four min&aelig;; and when he had made a libation, he pledged
them all at once, and gave them the cups to carry away with them. And
Anticlides the Athenian, in the sixteenth book of his Returns, speaking
of Gra, who, with other kings, first led a colony into the island of
Lesbos, and saying that those colonists had received an answer from
the oracle, bidding them, while sailing, throw a virgin into the sea,
as an offering to Neptune, proceeds as follows:&mdash;"And some people,
who treat of the history and affairs of Methymna, relate a fable

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 736]</span>

about the virgin who was thrown into the sea; and say that one of the
leaders was in love with her, whose name was Enalus, and that he dived
down, wishing to save the damsel; and that then both of them, being
hidden by the waves, disappeared. But that in the course of time, when
Methymna had now become populous, Enalus appeared again, and related
what had happened, and how it had happened: and said that the damsel
was still abiding among the Nereids, and that he himself had become the
superintendent of Neptune's horses; but that a great wave having been
cast on the shore, he had swam with it, and so come to land: and he had
in his hand a goblet made of gold, of such wondrous workmanship that
the golden goblets which they had, when compared with his, looked no
better than brass."</p>

<p>16. And in former times the possession of drinking-cups was reckoned a
very honourable thing. Accordingly, Achilles had a very superb cup as a
sort of heirloom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But, mindful of the gods, Achilles went<br />
To the rich coffer in his shady tent,<br />
(There lay the presents of the royal dame;)<br />
From thence he took a bowl of antique frame,<br />
Which never man had stain'd with ruddy wine,<br />
Nor raised in offerings to the pow'rs divine,<br />
But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none<br />
Had raised in offerings but to Jove alone.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
</div>

<p>And Priam, when offering ransom for his son, amid all his most
beautiful treasures especially offers a very exquisitely wrought cup.
And Jupiter himself, on the occasion of the birth of Hercules, thinks
a drinking-cup a gift worthy to be given to Alcmena; which he, having
likened himself to Amphitryon, presents to her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And she received the gift, and on the bowl<br />
Admiring gazed with much delighted soul.
</div>

<p>And Stesichorus says that the sun sails over the whole ocean in a bowl;
in which also Hercules passed over the sea, on the occasion of his
going to fetch the cows of Geryon. We are acquainted, too, with the cup
of Bathycles the Arcadian, which Bathycles left behind him as a prize
of wisdom to him who should be pronounced the best of those who were
called the wise men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 737]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>And a great many people have handled the cup of Nestor;
for many have written books about it. And drinking-cups were favourites
even among the Gods; at all events&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They pledged each other in their golden cups.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
</div>

<p>But it is a mark of a gentleman to be moderate in his use of wine, not
drinking too greedily, nor drinking large draughts without drawing
one's breath, after the fashion of the Thracians; but to mingle
conversation with his cups, as a sort of wholesome medicine.</p>

<p>17. And the ancients affixed a great value to such goblets as had
any story engraved upon them; and in the art of engraving cups in
this manner, a high reputation was enjoyed by Cimon and Athenocles.
They used also drinking-cups inlaid with precious stones. And
Menander, somewhere or other, speaks of drinking-cups turned by the
turning-lathe, and chased; and Antiphanes says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And others drain with eager lips the cup,<br />
Full of the juice of ancient wine, o'ershadow'd<br />
With sparkling foam,&mdash;the golden-wrought rich cup,<br />
Which circled round they raised: one long, deep draught<br />
They drain, and raise the bottom to the skies.
</div>

<p>And Nicomachus says to some one&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O you, who . . . . . and vomit golden . . . .
</div>

<p>And Philippides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Could you but see the well-prepared cups,<br />
All made of gold, my Trophimus; by heaven,<br />
They are magnificent! I stood amazed<br />
When I beheld them first. Then there were also<br />
Large silver cups, and jugs larger than I.
</div>

<p>And Parmenio, in his letter to Alexander, summing up the spoils of
the Persians, says, "The weight of goblets of gold is seventy-three
Babylonian talents, and fifty-two min&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The weight of goblets inlaid with precious stones, is fifty-six
Babylonian talents, and thirty-four min&aelig;."</p>

<p>18. And the custom was, to put the water into the cup first, and the
wine afterwards. Accordingly, Xenophanes says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 738]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
And never let a man a goblet take,<br />
And first pour in the wine; but let the water<br />
Come first, and after that, then add the wine.
</div>

<p>And Anacreon says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Bring me water&mdash;bring me wine,<br />
Quick, O boy; and bring, besides,<br />
Garlands, rich with varied flowers;<br />
And fill the cup, that I may not<br />
Engage in hopeless strife with love.
</div>

<p>And before either of them Hesiod had said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pour in three measures of the limpid stream,<br />
Pure from an everflowing spring; and then<br />
Add a fourth cup of sacred rosy wine.
</div>

<p>And Theophrastus says&mdash;"The ancient fashion of the mixture of wine was
quite opposite to the way in which it is managed at the present day;
for they were not accustomed to pour the water on the wine, but the
wine on the water, in order, when drinking, not to have their liquor
too strong, and in order also, when they had drunk to satiety, to
have less desire for more. And they also consumed a good deal of this
liquor, mixed as it was, in the game of the cottabus."</p>

<p>19. Now of carvers of goblets the following men had a high
reputation,&mdash;Athenocles, Crates, Stratonicus, Myrmecides the Milesian,
Callicrates the Laced&aelig;monian, and Mys; by which last artist we have
seen a Heraclean cup, having most beautifully wrought on it the capture
of Troy, and bearing also this inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sketch was by Parrhasius;&mdash;by Mys<br />
<span class="linespace1">The workmanship; and now I represent</span><br />
The lofty Troy, which great Achilles took.
</div>

<p>20. Now among the Cretans, the epithet <ins title="Greek: kleinos">κλεινὸς</ins>, illustrious,
is often given to the objects of one's affection. And it is a matter
of great desire among them to carry off beautiful boys; and among them
it is considered discreditable to a beautiful boy not to have a lover.
And the name given to the boys who are carried off in that manner is <ins title="Greek: parastathentes">παρασταθέντες</ins>.
And they give to the boy who has been carried
off a robe, and an ox, and a drinking-cup. And the robe they wear even
when they are become old, in order to show that they have been <ins title="Greek: kleinoi">κλεινοί</ins>.</p>

21. You see that when men drink, they then are rich;<br />
They do whate'er they please,&mdash;they gain their actions,<br />
They're happy themselves, and they assist their friends.

<p>For amusing oneself with wine exalts, and cherishes, and elevates the
mind, since it inflames and arouses the soul, and fills it with lofty
thoughts, as Pindar says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When the sad, laborious cares<br />

<p>22. There is a kind of drinking-cup also called ancyla, or curved; a
kind especially useful for the play of the cottabus. Cratinus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
'Tis death to drink of wine when water's mix'd:<br />
But she took equal shares, two choes full<br />
Of unmix'd wine, in a large ancyla:<br />
And calling on her dear Corinthian lover<br />
By name, threw in his honour a cottabus.
</div>

<p>And Bacchylides says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
When she does throw to the youths a cottabus<br />
From her ancyla, stretching her white arm forth.
</div>

<p>And it is with reference to this ancyla that we understand the
expression of &AElig;schylus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cottabus of th' ancyla (<ins title="Greek: ankylêtous kottabous">ἀγκυλήτους κοττάβους</ins>).
</div>

<p>Spears are also called <ins title="Greek: ankylêta">ἀγκύλητα</ins>, or curved; and also <ins title="Greek: mesankyla">μεσάγκυλα</ins>, held
by a string in the middle. There is also the expression <ins title="Greek: ap' ankylês">ἀπ᾽ ἀγκύλης</ins>,
which means, from the right hand. And the cup is called <ins title="Greek: ankylê">ἀγκύλη</ins>, from
the fact that the right hand is curved, in throwing the cottabus from
it. For it was a matter to which great attention was paid by the ancients&mdash;
namely, that of throwing the cottabus dexterously and gracefully. And
men in general prided themselves more on their dexterity in this than
in throwing the javelin skilfully. And this got its name from the
manner in which the hand was brandished in throwing the cottabus, when
they threw it elegantly and dexterously into the cottabium. And they
also built rooms especially designed for this sport.</p>

<p>23. In Timachides there is also a kind of drinking-cup mentioned,
called the &aelig;acis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 740]</span></p>

<p> There is another kind also, called the <ins title="Greek: akatos">ἄκατος</ins>,or boat, being shaped
like a boat. Epicrates sayss&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Throw down th' acatia,
</div>

<p>(using here the diminutive form,)</p>

<div class="blockindent">

Straight to the cup; . . . the younger maiden . . . .<br />

All ready, loose the cables, bend the sails.
</div>

<p>Among the Cyprians there is also a kind of cup called the aotus, as
Pamphilus tells us: and Philetas says, this is a cup which has no ears
(<ins title="Greek: ôtous">ὤτους</ins>).</p>

<p>There is also a kind of cup called aroclum, which is mentioned by
Nicander the Colophonian.</p>

<p>24. The cup called <ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>, is the same as that called <ins title="Greek: depas">δέπας</ins>. Homer,
in his Odyssey, speaking of Pisistratus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
In a rich golden cup he pour'd the wine;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
</div>

<p>and proceeding, he says, in the same manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To each a portion of the feast he bore,<br />
And held the golden goblet (<ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>) foaming o'er;
</div>

<p>and presently afterwards he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And gave the goblet (<ins title="Greek: depas">δέπας</ins>) to Ulysses' son.
</div>

<p>And, accordingly, Asclepiades the Myrlean says—"The <ins title="Greek: depas">δέπας</ins> appears
to me to have been much of the same shape as the <ins title="Greek: phialê">φιάλη</ins>. For men make
libations with it. Accordingly, Homer says, <ins title="Greek: depas">δέπαϛ</ins>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace6">The cup which Peleus' son</span><br />
Had raised in offerings to Jove alone.
</div>

<p>And it is called <ins title="Greek: depas">δέπας</ins>, either because it is given to all (<ins title="Greek: didotai
pasi">δίδοται πᾶσι</ins>) who wish to make libations, or who wish to drink; or because it
has two ears (<ins title="Greek: dyo ôpas">δύο ὦπας</ins>), for ὦπες must be the same as ὦτα. And it has
the name of <ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>, either from being very smooth (<ins title="Greek: agan leion">ἄγαν λεῖον</ins>), or
because the liquor is collected (<ins title="Greek: halizetai">ἁλίζεται</ins>) in it. And that it had two
ears is plain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>But when he applies the word <ins title="Greek: amphikypellon">ἀμφικύπελλον</ins> to it, he means nothing more
than <ins title="Greek: amphikyrton">ἀμφίκυρτον</ins> curved on both sides.” But Silenus interprets the word
<ins title="Greek: amphikypellon">ἀμφικύπελλον</ins> to mean devoid of ears, while others say that <ins title="Greek: amphi">ἀμφὶ</ins> here is
equivalent to <ins title="Greek: peri">περὶ</ins>, and that it means a cup which you may put to your
mouth all round, at any part of it. But Parthenius says that it
means that the ears are curved (<ins title="Greek: perikekyrtôsthai">περικεκυρτῶσθαι</ins>), for that is
synonymous with <ins title="Greek: kyrtos">κυρτός</ins>. But Anicetus says that the <ins title="Greek: kypellon">κύπελλον</ins> is a
kind of cup (<ins title="Greek: phialê">φίαλη</ins>), and that the word <ins title="Greek: amphikypellon">ἀμφικύπελλον</ins> is equivalent to
<ins title="Greek: hyperphialon">ὑπερφίαλον</ins>, that is to say, superb and magnificent; unless, indeed,
any one chooses to interpret the word <ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins> as something very highly
ornamented, and therefore not at all smooth (<ins title="Greek: a">α</ins>, <ins title="Greek: leion">λεῖον</ins>). And Pisander
says, Hercules gave Telamon a cup (<ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>) as the prize of his
preeminent valour in the expedition against Troy.</p>

<p>25. There is also a kind of cup called the horn of Amalthea, and
another called <ins title="Greek: eniautos">ἐνιαυτὸς</ins>, or the year.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of cup made of wood, called <ins title="Greek: amphôtis">ἄμφωτις</ins>,
which Philetas says that the countrymen use, who milk their cattle into
it, and then drink the milk.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of drinking called <ins title="Greek: amystis">ἄμυστις</ins>, when any one drinks a
long draught without taking breath and without winking (<ins title="Greek: mê mysanta">μὴ μύσαντα</ins>).
And they give the same name to the goblets from which it is easy to
drink in this manner. And they also use a verb (<ins title="Greek: ekmystizô">ἐκμυστίζω</ins>) for drinking
without taking breath, as Plato the comic poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And opening a fair cask of fragrant wine,<br />
He pours it straight into the hollow cup;<br />
And then he drank it sheer and not disturb'd,<br />
And drain'd it at one draught (<ins title="Greek: exemystise">ἐξεμύστισε</ins>).
</div>

<p>And they also drank the <ins title="Greek: TamystisEXT">ἄμυστις</ins> draught to an accompaniment of
music; the melody being measured out according to the quickness of the
time; as Ameipsias says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Gentle musician, let that dulcet strain<br />

<p>26. There is also a kind of cup called Antigonis, from the name of king
Antigonus: like the Seleucis from king Seleucus; and the Prusis, from
king Prusias.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of cup known in Crete, and called anaph&aelig;a, which
they use for hot drinks.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of cup called aryballus. This kind of cup is wider
at the bottom, and contracted at top like a purse when it is drawn
together; and, indeed, some people call purses <ins title="Greek: aryballoi">ἀρύβαλλοι</ins>,
from their resemblance to this kind of cup. Aristophanes says, in his
Knights&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 742]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace8">He pour'd upon his head</span><br />
Ambrosia from a holy cup (<ins title="Greek: aryballos">ἀρύβαλλος</ins>).
</div>

<p>And the aryballus is not very different from the arystichus, being
derived from the verbs <ins title="Greek: arytô">ἀρύτω</ins> and <ins title="Greek: ballô">βάλλω</ins>;
they also call a jug <ins title="Greek: arystis">ἄρυστις</ins>.
Sophocles says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You are most accursed of all women,<br />
Who come to supper with your <ins title="Greek: arysteis">ἀρύστεις</ins>.
</div>

<p>There is also a city of the Ionians called arystis.</p>

<p>There is another kind of cup called argyris, which is not necessarily
made of silver. Anaxilas says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And drinking out of golden argyrides.
</div>

<p>27. Then batiacium, labronius, tragelaphus, pristis, are all names of
different kinds of cups. The batiaca is a Persian goblet. And among the
letters of the great Alexander to the Satraps of Asia there is inserted
one letter in which the following passage occurs:&mdash;"There are three
batiac&aelig; of silver-gilt, and a hundred and seventy-six silver condya;
and of these last thirty-three are gilt. There is also one silver
tigisites, and thirty-two silver-gilt mystri. There is one silver
vegetable dish, and one highly wrought wine-stand of silver ornamented
in a barbaric style. There are other small cups from every country,
and of every kind of fashion, to the number of twenty-nine: and other
small-sized cups called rhyta, adbatia, and Lycurgi, all gilt, and
incense-burners and spoons."</p>

<p>There is a cup used by the Alexandrians named bessa, wider in the lower
parts, and narrow above.</p>

<p>28. There is also a kind of cup called baucalis: and this, too, is
chiefly used in Alexandria, as Sopater the parodist says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A baucalis, with four rings mark'd on it.

<p>And in another passage he says&mdash;</p>

<p>And the men in Alexandria, it is said, have a way of working crystal,
forming it often into various shapes of goblets, and imitating in this
material every sort of earthenware cup which is imported from any
possible country. And they say that Lysippus the statuary, wishing to
gratify Cassander, when he was founding the colony of Cassandria, and
when he
conceived the ambition of inventing some peculiar kind of utensil in
earthenware, on account of the extraordinary quantity of Mendean wine
which was exported from the city, took a great deal of pains with that
study, and brought Cassander a great number of cups of every imaginable
fashion, all made of earthenware, and taking a part of the pattern of
each, thus made one goblet of a design of his own.</p>

<p>29. There is also a kind of cup called bicus. Xenophon, in
the first book of his Anabasis, says:&mdash;
"And Cyrus sent him a number of goblets (<ins title="Greek: bikous">βίκους</ins>) of wine half full;
and it is a cup of a flat shallow shape, like a <ins title="Greek: phialê">φιάλη</ins>, according to the
description given of it by Pollux the Parian.</p>

<p>There is another kind of cup called the bombylius; a sort of Rhodian
Thericlean cup; concerning the shape of which Socrates says,&mdash;"Those
who drink out of the phiale as much as they please will very soon give
over; but those who drink out of a bombylius drink by small drops."
There is also an animal of the same name.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of drinking-cup called the bromias, in form like
the larger kind of scyphus.</p>

<p>30. There is another kind called the lettered cup, having writing
engraved round it. Alexis says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Shall I describe to you the appearance first</span><br />
O' the cup you speak of? Know, then, it was round;<br />
Exceeding small; old, sadly broken too<br />
About the ears; and all around the brim<br />
Were carved letters.<br />
<span class="linespace7_5"><i>B.</i> Were there those nineteen</span><br />
Engraved in gold,&mdash;To Jupiter the Saviour?<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Those, and no others.</span>
</div>

<p>And we have seen a lettered cup of this kind lying at Capua in
Campania, in the temple of Diana; covered with writing taken from the
poems of Homer, and beautifully engraved; having the verses inlaid
in golden characters, like the drinking-cup of Nestor. And Ach&aelig;us
the tragic poet, in his Omphale, himself also represents the Satyrs
speaking in the following manner about a lettered drinking-cup&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the god's cup long since has call'd me,<br />
Showing this writing,&mdash;delta, then iota,<br />
The third letter was omega, then nu,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 744]</span>

Then u came next, and after that a sigma<br />
And omicron were not deficient.
</div>

<p>But in this passage we want the final <ins title="Greek: u">υ</ins> which ought to have
ended the word. Since all the ancients used the omicron not only with
the power which it has now, but also when they meant to indicate the
diphthong <ins title="Greek: ou">ου</ins> they wrote it by <ins title="Greek: o">ο</ins> only. And they did
the same when they wished to write the vowel <ins title="Greek: e">ε</ins>, whether it is
sounded by itself, or when they wish to indicate the diphthong <ins title="Greek: ei">ει</ins>
by the addition of iota. And accordingly, in the above-cited
verses, the Satyrs wrote the final syllable of the genitive case
<ins title="Greek: Dionysou">Διονύσου</ins> with <ins title="Greek: o">ο</ins> only; as being short to engrave: so
that we are in these lines to understand the final upsilon, so as to
make the whole word <ins title="Greek: Dionysou">Διονύσου</ins>. And the Dorians called sigma
san; for the musicians, as Aristoxenus often tells us, used to avoid
saying sigma whenever they could, because it was a hard-sounding
letter, and unsuited to the flute; but they were fond of using the
letter rho, because of the ease of pronouncing it. And the horses
which have the letter <ins title="Greek: S">Σ</ins> branded on them, they call samphoras.
Aristophanes, in his Clouds, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Neither you, nor the carriage-horse, nor samphoras.
</div>

<p>And Pindar says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Before long series of songs were heard,<br />
And the ill-sounding san from out men's mouths.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus also, in his Neottis, speaks of a lettered cup as being
called by that identical name, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Above all things I hate a letter'd cup,</span><br />
Since he, my son, the time he went away,<br />
Had such a cup with him.<br />
<span class="linespace9_75"><i>B.</i> There are many like it.</span>
</div>

<p>31. There is a kind of cup also called gyala. Philetas, in his
Miscellanies, says that the Megarians call their cups gyal&aelig;. And
Parthenius, the pupil of Dionysius, in the first book of his
Discussions upon Words found in the Historians, says&mdash;"The gyala is a
kind of drinking-cup, as Marsyas the priest of Hercules writes, where
he says, 'Whenever the king comes into the city, a man meets him having
a cup (<ins title="Greek: gyalên">γυάλην</ins>) full of wine; and the king takes it, and pours
a libation from it.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 745]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>32. There is another sort of cup called the deinus. And that this is
the name of a cup we are assured by Dionysius of Sinope, in his Female
Saviour, where he gives a catalogue of the names of cups, and mentions
this among them, speaking as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And as for all the kinds of drinking-cups,<br />
Lady, all fair to see,&mdash;dicotyli,<br />
Tricotyli besides, the mighty deinus,<br />
Which holds an entire measure, and the cymbion,<br />
The scyphus and the rhytum; on all these<br />
The old woman keeps her eyes, and minds nought else.
</div>

<p>And Cleanthes the philosopher, in his book on Interpretation, says,
that the cups called the Thericlean, and that called the Deinias, are
both named from the original makers of them. And Seleucus, saying that
the deinus is a kind of cup, quotes some lines of Stratis, from his
Medea&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Dost know, O Creon, what the upper part<br />
Of your head doth resemble? I can tell you:<br />
'Tis like a deinus turned upside down.
</div>

<p>And Archedicus, in his Man in Error, introducing a servant speaking of
some courtesans, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I lately introduced a hook-nosed woman,</span><br />
Her name Nicostrata; but surnamed also<br />
Scotodeina, since (at least that is the story)<br />
She stole a silver deinus in the dark.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> A terrible thing (<ins title="Greek: deinon">δεινὸν</ins>), by Jove; a terrible thing!</span>
</div>

<p>The deinus is also the name of a kind of dance, as Apollophanes tells
us in his Dalis, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A strange thing (<ins title="Greek: deinon">δεινὸν</ins>) is this deinus and calathiscus.
</div>

<p>And Telesilla the Argive calls a threshing-floor also <ins title="Greek: deinos">δεῖνος</ins>.
And the Cyren&aelig;ans give the same name to a foot-tub, as Philetas tells
us in his Attic Miscellanies.</p>

<p>33. There is also a kind of drinking-cup called <ins title="Greek: depastron">δέπαστρον</ins>.
Silenus and Clitarchus, in their Dialects, say that this is a name
given to drinking-cups among the Clitorians; but Antimachus the
Colophonian, in the fifth book of his Thebais, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And carefully they all commands obey'd<br />
Which wise Adrastus laid on them. They took<br />
A silver goblet, and they pour'd therein<br />
Water, and honey pure, compounding deftly;<br />
And quickly then they all distributed<br />
The cups (<ins title="Greek: depastra">δέπαστπα</ins>) among the princes of the Greeks,<br />
Who there were feasting; and from a golden jug<br />
They pour'd them wine for due libations.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let others bring the bowl of solid silver,<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 746]</span>

Or golden cups (<ins title="Greek: depastra">δέπαστρα</ins>), which in my halls are stored.
</div>

<p>And immediately afterwards he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And golden cups (<ins title="Greek: depastra">δέπαστρα</ins>), and a pure untouch'd vessel<br />
Of honey sweet, which will be best for him.
</div>

<p>34. There is also a kind of cup called <ins title="Greek: daktylôton">δακτυλωτὸν</ins>, with
finger-like handles; and it is called so by Ion, in the Agamemnon&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And you shall have a gift worth running for,<br />
A finger-handled cup, not touch'd by fire,<br />
The mighty prize once given by Pelias,<br />
And by swift Castor won.
</div>

<p>But by this expression Epigenes understands merely having two ears,
into which a person could put his fingers on each side. Others, again,
explain it as meaning, having figures like fingers engraved all round
it; or having small projections like the Sidonian cups;&mdash;or, again,
some interpret the word as meaning merely smooth. But when he says,
untouched by fire, that has the same meaning as Homer's phrase&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: apyron katethêke lebêta">ἄπυρον κατέθηκε λέβητα</ins>,
</div>

<p>meaning a caldron fit for the reception of cold water, or suitable for
drinking cold drinks out of. But by this expression some understand
a horn; and about the Molossian district the oxen are said to have
enormous horns; and the way in which they are made into cups is
explained by Theopompus: and it is very likely that Pelias may have had
cups made of these horns; and Iolcos is near the Molossian district,
and it was at Iolcos that these contests spoken of were exhibited by
Pelias.&mdash;"But," says Didymus, in his Explanation of the play here
spoken of, "it is better to say that Ion misunderstood Homer's words,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And for the fifth he gave a double bowl,<br />
Which fire had never touch'd;
</div>

<p>for he fancied that this meant a drinking-cup, while it was in reality
a large flat vessel made of brass in the form of a caldron, suitable to
receive cold water. And he has spoken of the dactylotus cup, as if it
were a goblet that had a hollow place all round the inside of it, so
as to be taken hold of inside by the fingers of the drinkers. And some
say that the cup which has never been touched by fire means a cup of
horn; for that that is not worked by the agency of fire. And perhaps a
man might call a <ins title="Greek: phialê">φιάλη</ins> a drinking-cup by a metaphorical use
of the word." But Philemon, in his treatise on Attic Nouns and Attic
Dialects, under the word <ins title="Greek: kalpis">καλπὶς</ins> says, "The dactylotus cup is
the same as the two-headed cup into which a person can insert his
fingers on both sides. But some say that
it is one which has figures in the shape of fingers carved all round
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 747]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>35. There is also the elephant; and this was the name of a kind of cup,
as we are told by Damoxenus, in the Man who laments himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> If that is not enough, here is the boy</span><br />
Bringing the elephant.<br />
<span class="linespace8_25"><i>B.</i> In God's name tell me,</span><br />

<span class="linespace7"><i>A.</i> 'Tis a mighty cup,</span><br />

The work of Alcon. When I was at Cypseli,<br />
Ad&aelig;us pledged me in this self-same cup.
</div>

<p>And Epinicus also mentions this cup, in his Supposititious Damsels; and
I will quote his testimony when I come to speak of the rhytum.</p>

<p>36. There is another kind of cup called the Ephebus. And Philemon the
Athenian, in his treatise on Attic Nouns and Attic Dialects, says that
this cup is also called the embasicoitas; but Stephanus the comic poet,
in his Friend of the Laced&aelig;monians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg2"><i>Sos.</i> The king then pledged him in a certain village.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> A wondrous thing. What can you mean? Is this</span><br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Why, my whole thoughts were borne</span><br />
Off to the Rhodian cups, O Sosia,<br />
And to those heavy bowls they call ephebi.
</div>

<p>37. There are also some cups which are called <ins title="Greek: hêdypotides">ἡδυποτίδες</ins>.
"These," says Lynceus the Samian, "were made by the Rhodians in
emulation of the Thericlean goblets which were in use at Athens. But
as the Athenians, on account of the great weight of metal employed
in them, only made this shape for the use of the richer classes,
the Rhodians made theirs so light that they were able to put these
ornaments within the reach even of the poor. And Epigenes mentions
them, in his Heroine, in these words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A psycter, and a cyathus, and cymbia,<br />
Four rhyta, and three hedypotides,<br />
A silver strainer, too.
</div>

<p>And Semus, in the fifth book of his Delias, says that there is among

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 748]</span>

the offerings at Delos a golden hedypotis, the gift of Echenica, a
woman of the country, whom he mentions also, in his eighth book. And
Cratinus the younger says, using the diminutive form,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And Archephon had twelve <ins title="Greek: hêdypotia">ἡδυπότια</ins>.
</div>

<p>38. There was another kind of cup called the Herculeum. Pisander, in
the second book of his Herculead, says that the cup in which Hercules
sailed across the ocean belonged to the Sun; and that Hercules received
it from Oceanus for that purpose. But, perhaps, as the hero was fond of
large cups, the poets and historians jesting because of the great size
of this one, invented the fable of his having gone to sea in a cup.
But Panyasis, in the first book of his Herculead, says that Hercules
obtained the cup of the Sun from Nereus, and sailed even to Erythea in
it. And we have said before that Hercules was one of the inordinate
drinkers. And that the sun was borne on towards his setting in a cup,
Stesichorus tells us, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the Sun, great Hyperion's offspring,<br />
Embarked in his golden cup, that he<br />
Might cross the ocean's wide expanse, and come<br />
To the deep foundations of immortal Night;<br />
To his fond mother, and his virgin bride,<br />
And his dear children. And the son of Jove<br />
<span class="linespace5">Came to the grove</span><br />
<span class="linespace3">Shaded with laurels and with bays.</span>
</div>

<p>And Antimachus speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the most illustrious Erythea<br />
Sent the Sun forth in a convenient cup.
</div>

<p>And &AElig;schylus, in his Daughters of the Sun, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There in the west is found the golden cup,<br />
Great Vulcan's work, your father's property,<br />
In which he's borne along his rapid course<br />
O'er the dark waters of the boundless sea.<br />
When, his work done, he flies before dark Night,<br />
Borne on her black-horsed chariot.
</div>

<p>39. And Mimnermus, in his Nannus, says that the Sun when asleep is
borne round to the east, lying on a golden bed which was made for this
express purpose by Vulcan; by which enigmatical statement hie indicates
the hollow form of the cup; and he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 749]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
For the Sun labours every day, nor ever<br />
<span class="linespace1">Do he or his fleet steeds know pleasing rest</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">Leaving her ocean-bed, mounts up to heaven.</span><br />
For all across the sea, a lovely bed<br />
<span class="linespace1">Of precious gold, the work of Vulcan's hands,</span><br />
Conveys the god; passing on rapid wings<br />
<span class="linespace1">Along the water, while he sleeps therein,</span><br />

<span class="linespace1">Ascends again his swift untiring car.</span>
</div>

<p>But Theolytus, in the second book of his Annals, says that the Sun
crosses the sea in a cup, and that the first person who invented this
statement was the author of the poem called the Battle of the Titans.
And Pherecydes, in the third book of his Histories, having previously
spoken about the ocean, adds&mdash;"But Hercules drew his bow against him,
as if he meant to shoot him: and the Sun bade him desist, and so he,
being afraid, did desist. And in return for his forbearance, the Sun
gave him the golden cup in which he himself used to travel with his
horses when he has set, going all night across the ocean to the east,
where he again rises. And so then Hercules went in this cup to Erythea.
And when he was at sea, Oceanus, to tempt him, appeared to him in
visible form, tossing his cup about in the waves; and he then was on
the point of shooting Oceanus; but Oceanus being frightened desired him
to forbear."</p>

<p>40. There is also a cup of the name of ethanion. Hellanicus, in his
account of the History and Manners of the Egyptians, writes thus—"In
the houses of the Egyptians are found a brazen <ins title="Greek: phialê">φιάλη</ins>, and a brazen
<ins title="Greek: kyathos">κύαθος</ins>, and a brazen <ins title="Greek: êthanion">ἠθάνιον</ins>."</p>

<p>There is another kind called hemitomus; a sort of cup in use among the
Athenians, so called from its shape; and it is mentioned by Pamphilus,
in his Dialects.</p>

<p>41. Then there is the cup called the thericlean cup; this kind is
depressed at the sides, sufficiently deep, having short ears, as being
of the class of cup called <ins title="Greek: êthanion">κύλιξ</ins>.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> And, perhaps, it is out
of a thericlean cup that Alexis, in his Hesione, represents Hercules to
be drinking, when he speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 750]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
And when he had, though scarcely, come t' himself,<br />
He begg'd a cup of wine (<ins title="Greek: kylika">κύλικα</ins>), and when he'd got it,<br />
He drank down frequent draughts, and drain'd it well;<br />
And, as the proverb says, the man sometimes<br />
Is quite a bladder, and sometimes a sack.
</div>

<p>And that the thericlean cup belongs to the class <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins> is plainly
stated by Theophrastus, in his History of Plants. For speaking of the
turpentine-tree, be says—“And thericlean cups (<ins title="Greek: kylikes thêrikleioi">κύλικες θηρίκλειοι</ins>)
are turned of this wood, in such a manner that no one can distinguish
them from earthenware ones." And Thericles the Corinthian is said to
have been the first maker of this kind of cup, and he was a potter
originally, and it is after him that they have their name; and he lived
about the same time as Aristophanes the comic poet. And Theopompus
speaks of this cup, in his Nemea, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Come hither you, you faithful child of Thericles,</span><br />
You noble shape, and what name shall we give you<br />
Are you a looking-glass of nature? If<br />
You were but full, then I could wish for nothing<br />
Beyond your presence. Come then&mdash;<br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> And when you've drunk your fill, then hand the cup</span><br />
Over to me the first.
</div>

<p>But Cleanthes, in his treatise on Interpretation, says&mdash;"And as for all
these inventions, and whatever others there are of the same kind, such
as the thericlean cup, the deinias, the iphicratis, it is quite plain
that these, by their very names, indicate their inventors. And the same
appears to be the case even now. And if they fail to do so, the name
must have changed its meaning a little. But, as has been said before,
one cannot in every case trust to a name." But others state that the
thericlean cup has its name from the skins of wild beasts
(<ins title="Greek: thêriôn">θηρίων</ins>) being carved on it. And Pamphilus of Alexandria says that
it is so called from the fact of Bacchus disturbing the beasts (<ins title="Greek: tous thêras">τοὺς
θῆρας</ins>) by pouring libations out of these cups over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 751]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>42. And Antiphanes mentions this kind of cup, in his Similitudes,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And when they had done supper, (for I wish<br />
To put all things that happen'd in the interval<br />
Together,) then the thericlean cup<br />
Of Jove the Saviour was introduced,<br />
Full of the luscious drops which o'er the sea<br />
Came from the isle of the delicious drinks,<br />
The sea-girt Lesbos, full, and foaming up,<br />
And each one in his right hand gladly seized it.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus, in his Dolon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I never drain'd a cup more carefully,<br />
For I did make the earthen cask more clean<br />
Than Thericles did make his well-turn'd cups<br />
E'en in his youth.
</div>

<p>And, in his Dice-players, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then they drain'd the valiant cup yclept<br />
The thericlean; foaming o'er the brim,<br />
With Laced&aelig;monian lip, loud sounding<br />

Sparkling and brilliant, beautifully wash'd,<br />
All crown'd with ivy; and the while they call'd<br />

<p>And Ararus, or Eubulus, whichever it was who was the author of the
Campylion, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O potter's earth, you whom great Thericles<br />
Once fashion'd, widening out the circling depth<br />

</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Horseman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is, besides, a thericlean cup,<br />
Having a golden wreath of ivy round it,<br />
Carved on it, not appended.
</div>

<p>And in his Little Horse he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He drank a thericlean cup of unmix'd wine,<br />
Right full, and foaming o'er the brim.
</div>

<p>43. But Tim&aelig;us, in the twenty-eighth book of his History, calls the cup
thericlea, writing thus:&mdash;"There was a man of the name of Polyxenus who
was appointed one of the ambassadors from Tauromenium, and he returned
having received several other presents from Nicodemus, and also a
cup of the kind called thericlea." And Ad&aelig;us, in his treatise on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 752]</span>

Descriptions, considers that the thericleum and the carchesium are the
same. But that they are different is plainly shown by Callixenus, who,
in his Account of Alexandria and its customs, says&mdash;"And some people
marched in the procession, bearing thericlea (and he uses the masculine
form <ins title="Greek: thêrikleious">θηρικλείους</ins>), and others bearing carchesia.” And what kind of
cup the carchesium was, shall be explained in due time. There is also
another kind called the thericlean bowl (<ins title="Greek: thêrikleios kratêr">θηρίκλειος κρατὴρ</ins>), which is
mentioned by Alexis, in his Cycnus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And in the midst a thericlean bowl<br />
Resplendent stood; full of old clear white wine,<br />
And foaming to the brim. I took it empty,<br />
And wiped it round, and made it shine, and placed it<br />
Firm on its base, and crown'd it round with branches<br />
Of Bacchus' favourite ivy.
</div>

<p>Menander also has used the form <ins title="Greek: thêrikleios">θηρίκλειος</ins> as feminine,

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And Polemo, in the first book of his treatise on the Acropolis at

offered up some golden thericlean cups (<ins title="Greek: ta thêrikleia">τὰ θηρίκλεια</ins>) wrought
on foundations of wood."</p>

<p>44. And Apollodorus of Gela, in his Philadelphia or the Man who killed
himself by Starvation, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then there were robes of fine embroidery,<br />

He mixes beautifully a large cup<br />

<p>There is also a cup called the Isthmian cup: and Pamphilus, in his
treatise on Names, says that this is a name given to a certain kind of
cup by the inhabitants of Cyprus.</p>

<p>45. There is also a kind of vessel called cadus; which Simmias states
to be a kind of cup, quoting this verse of Anacreon&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I breakfasted on one small piece of cheesecake,<br />

<p>But Clitarchus, in his treatise on Dialects, says that the Ionians
call an earthenware cask <ins title="Greek: kados">κάδος</ins>. And Herodotus, in his third book,
speaks of a cask (<ins title="Greek: kados">κάδος</ins>) of palm wine.</p>

<p>46. There is also the <ins title="Greek: kadiskos">καδίσκος</ins>. Philemon, in his treatise
before mentioned, says that this too is a species of cup. And it is a
vessel in which they place the Ctesian Jupiters, as Anticlides says,
in his Book on Omens, where he writes,&mdash;"The statuettes of Jupiter
Ctesius ought to be erected in this manner. One ought to place a new
cadiscus with two ears . . . . &mdash;and crown the ears with white wool; and on
the right shoulder, and on the forehead . . . . and put on it what you find
there, and pour ambrosia over it. But ambrosia is compounded of pure
water, and oil, and all kinds of fruits; and these you must pour over."
Stratis the comic poet also mentions the cadiscus, in his Lemnomeda,
where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The wine of Mercury, which some draw forth<br />
From a large jug, and some from a cadiscus,<br />

<p>47. There is also the cantharus. Now, that this is the name of a kind
of boat is well known. And that there is a kind of cup also called by
this name we find from Ameipsias, in his Men Playing at the Cottabus,
or Madness, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>And Alexis, in his Creation (the sentence refers to some one drinking

And then I saw Hermaiscus turning over<br />
One of these mighty canthari, and near him<br />

says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But I (for opposite the house there was<br />

<p>And Polemo, in his treatise on Painters, addressed to Antigonus,
says&mdash;"At Athens, at the marriage of Pirithous, Hippeus made a wine

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 756]</span>

jug and goblet of stone, inlaying its edges with gold. And he provided
also couches of pinewood placed on the ground, adorned with coverlets
of every sort, and for drinking-cups there were canthari made of
earthenware. And moreover, the lamp which was suspended from the roof,
had a number of lights all kept distinct from one another. And that
this kind of cup got its name originally from Cantharus a potter, who
invented it, Philet&aelig;rus tells us in his Achilles&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Peleus?&mdash;but Peleus<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> is a potter's name,<br />
The name of some dry wither'd lamp-maker,<br />
Known too as Cantharus, exceeding poor,<br />
Far other than a king, by Jove.
</div>

<p>And that cantharus is also the name of a piece of female ornament, we
may gather from Antiphanes in his Boeotia.</p>

<p>49. There is also a kind of cup called carchesium. Callixenus the
Rhodian, in his History of the Affairs and Customs of Alexandria, says
that it is a cup of an oblong shape, slightly contracted in the middle,
having ears which reach down to the bottom. And indeed, the carchesium
is a tolerably oblong cup, and perhaps it has its name from its being
stretched upwards. But the carchesium is an extremely old description
of cup; if at least it is true that Jupiter, when he had gained the
affections of Alcmena, gave her one as a love gift, as Pherecydes
relates in his second book, and Herodorus of Heraclea tells the same
story. But Asclepiades the Myrlean says that this cup derives its name
from some one of the parts of the equipment of a ship. For the lower
part of the mast is called the pterna, which goes down into the socket;
and the middle of the mast is called the neck; and towards the upper
part it is called carchesium. And the carchesium has yards running out
on each side, and in it there is placed what is called the breastplate,
being four-cornered on all sides, except just at the bottom and at the
top. Both of which extend a little outwards in a straight line. And
above the breastplate is a part which is called the distaff, running up
to a great height, and being sharp-pointed. And Sappho also speaks of
the carchesia, where she says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 757]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
And they all had well-fill'd carchesia,<br />
And out of them they pour'd libations, wishing<br />
All manner of good fortune to the bridegroom.
</div>

<p>And Sophocles, in his Tyro, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And they were at the table in the middle,<br />
Between the dishes and carchesia;
</div>

<p>saying that the dragons came up to the table, and took up a position
between the meats and the carchesia, or cups of wine. For it was the
fashion among the ancients to place upon the table goblets containing
mixed wine; as Homer also represents the tables in his time. And the
carchesium was named so from having on it rough masses like millet
(<ins title="Greek: kenchroeidês">κεγχροειδὴς</ins>), and the <ins title="Greek: a">α</ins> is
by enallage instead of <ins title="Greek: e">ε</ins>, <ins title="Greek: karchêsion">καρχήσιον</ins> for
<ins title="Greek: kerchêsion">κερχήσιον</ins>. On which account Homer calls those who are overcome by
thirst <ins title="Greek: karchaleous">καρχαλέους</ins>. And Charon of Lampsacus, in his Annals, says that
among the Lacedæmonians there is still shown the very same cup which
was given by Jupiter to Alcmena, when he took upon himself the likeness
of Amphitryon.</p>

<p>There is another kind of cup called calpium, a sort of Erythr&aelig;an
goblet, as Pamphilus says; and I imagine it is the same as the one
called scaphium.</p>

<p>50. There is another kind of cup called celebe. And this description of
drinking-cup is mentioned by Anacreon, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come, O boy, and bring me now<br />
A celebe, that I may drink<br />
A long deep draught, and draw no breath.<br />
It will ten measures of water hold,<br />
And five of mighty Chian wine.
</div>

<p>But it is uncertain what description of cup it is, or whether every
cup is not called celebe, because one pours libations into it (<ins title="Greek: apo tou cheein loibê">ἀπὸ τοῦ
χέειν λοιβὴν</ins>),or from one's pouring libations (<ins title="Greek: leibein">λείβειν</ins>). And the verb
<ins title="Greek: leibô">λείβω</ins> is applied habitually to every sort of liquid, from which also
the word <ins title="Greek: lebês">λέβης</ins> is derived. But Silenus and Clitarchus say that celebe
is a name given to drinking-cups by the &AElig;olians. But Pamphilus says
that the celebe is the same cup which is also called thermopotis, a
cup to drink warm water from. And Nicander the Colophonian, in his
Dialects, says that the celebe is a vessel used by the shepherds in
which they preserve honey. For Antimachus the Colophonian, in the
fifth book of his Thebais, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 758]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
He bade the heralds bear to them a bladder<br />
Fill'd with dark wine, and the most choice of all,<br />
The celebea in his house which lay,<br />
Fill'd with pure honey.
</div>

<p>And in a subsequent passage he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But taking up a mighty celebeum<br />
In both his hands, well fill'd with richest honey,<br />
Which in great store he had most excellent.
</div>

<p>And again he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And golden cups of wine, and then besides,<br />
A celebeum yet untouch'd by man,<br />
Full of pure honey, his most choice of treasures.
</div>

<p>And in this passage he very evidently speaks of the celebeum as some
kind of vessel distinct from a drinking-cup, since he has already
mentioned drinking-cups under the title of <ins title="Greek: depastra">δέπαστρα</ins>. And
Theocritus the Syracusan, in his Female Witches, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And crown this celebeum with the wool,<br />
Well dyed in scarlet, of the fleecy sheep.
</div>

<p>And Euphorion says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Or whether you from any other stream<br />
Have fill'd your celebe with limpid water.
</div>

<p>And Anacreon says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the attendant pour'd forth luscious wine,<br />
Holding a celebe of goodly size.
</div>

<p>But Dionysius, surnamed the Slender, explaining the poem of
Theodoridas, which is addressed to Love, says that celebe is a name
given to a kind of upstanding cup, something like the prusias and the
thericleum.</p>

<p>51. There is also the horn. It is said that the first men drank out of
the horns of oxen; from which circumstance Bacchus often figured with
horns on his head, and is moreover called a bull by many of the poets.
And at Cyzicus there is a statue of him with a bull's head. But that
men drank out of horns (<ins title="Greek: kerata">κερατα</ins>) is plain from the fact that to
this very day, when men mix water with wine, they say that they <ins title="Greek: kerasai">κερασαι</ins>
(mix it). And the vessel in which the wine is mixed is called <ins title="Greek: kratêr">κρατηρ</ins>,
from the fact of the water being mingled (<ins title="Greek: synkirnasthai">συγκιρνασθαι</ins>) in it, as if
the word were <ins title="Greek: keratêr">κερατηρ</ins>, from the drink being poured <ins title="Greek: eis to keras">εις το κερας</ins> (into
the horn); and even to this day the fashion of making horns into cups
continues: but some people call these cups rhyta. And many
of the poets represent the ancients as drinking out of horns. Pindar,
speaking of the Centaurs, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 759]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-HORNS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
After those monsters fierce<br />
Learnt the invincible strength of luscious wine;<br />
Then with a sudden fury,<br />
With mighty hands they threw the snow-white milk<br />
<span class="linespace1">Down from the board,</span><br />
<span class="linespace1">And of their own accord</span><br />
Drank away their senses in the silver-mounted horns.
</div>

<p>And Xenophon, in the seventh book of his Anabasis, giving an account of
the banquet which was given by the Thracian Seuthes, writes thus: "But
when Xenophon, with his companions, arrived at Seuthes's palace, first
of all they embraced one another, and then, according to the Thracian
fashion, they were presented with horns of wine." And in his sixth book
he says, when he is speaking of the Paphlagonians, "And they supped
lying on couches made of leaves, and they drank out of cups made of
horn." And &AElig;schylus, in his Perrh&aelig;bi, represents the Perrh&aelig;bi as using
horns for cups, in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace5">With silver-mounted horns,</span><br />
Fitted with mouthpieces of rich-wrought gold.
</div>

<p>And Sophocles, in his Pandora, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And when a man has drain'd the golden cup,<br />
She, pressing it beneath her tender arm,<br />
Returns it to him full.
</div>

<p>And Hermippus, in his Fates, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Do you now know the thing you ought to do?<br />
Give not that cup to me; but from this horn<br />
Give me but once more now to drink a draught.
</div>

<p>And Lycurgus the orator, in his Oration against Demades, says that
Philip the king pledged those men whom he loved in a horn. And
Theopompus, in the second book of his history of the Affairs and
Actions of Philip, says that the kings of the P&aelig;onians, as the oxen
in their countries have enormous horns, so large as to contain three
or four choes of wine, make drinking-cups of them, covering over the
brims with silver or with gold. And Philoxenus of Cythera, in his poem
entitled The Supper, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He then the sacred drink of nectar quaff'd<br />
From the gold-mounted brims of th' ample horns,<br />
And then they all did drink awhile.
</div>

<p>And the Athenians made also silver goblets in the shape of horns,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 760]</span>

and drank out of them. And one may ascertain that by seeing the
articles mentioned in writing among the list of confiscated goods on
the pillar which lies in the Acropolis, which contains the sacred
offerings&mdash;"There is also a silver horn drinking-cup, very solid."</p>

<p>52. There is also the cernus. This is a vessel made of earthenware,
having many little cup-like figures fastened to it, in which are white
poppies, wheat-ears, grains of barley, peas, pulse, vetches, and
lentils. And he who carries it, like the man who carries the mystic
fan, eats of these things, as Ammonius relates in the third book of his
treatise on Altars and Sacrifices.</p>

<p>53. There is also the cup called the cissybium. This is a cup with but
one handle, as Philemon says. And Neoptolemus the Parian, in the third
book of his Dialects, says that this word is used by Euripides in the
Andromache, to signify a cup made of (<ins title="Greek: kissinon">κίσσινον</ins>)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And all the crowd of shepherds flock'd together,<br />
One hearing a huge ivy bowl of milk,<br />
Refreshing medicine of weary toil;<br />
Another brought the juice o' the purple vine.
</div>

<p>For, says he, the cissybium is mentioned in a rustic assembly, where it
is most natural that the cups should be made of wood. But Clitarchus
says that the &AElig;olians called the cup which is elsewhere called scyphus,
cissybium. And Marsyas says that it is a wooden cup, the same as the <ins title="Greek: kypellon">κύπελλον</ins>.
But Eumolpus says that it is a species of cup which
perhaps (says he) was originally made of the wood of the ivy. But
Nicander the Colophonian, in the first book of his History of &AElig;tolia,
writes thus:&mdash;"In the sacred festival of Jupiter Didym&aelig;us they pour
libations from leaves of ivy (<ins title="Greek: kissou">κισσοῦ</ins>), from which circumstance the
ancient cups are called cissybia. Homer says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Holding a cup (<ins title="Greek: kissybion">κισσύβιον</ins>) of dark rich-colour'd wine.
</div>

<p>And Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his essay on the cup called
Nestoris, says, "No one of the men in the city or of the men of
moderate fortune used to use the <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins> or the <ins title="Greek: kissybion">κισσύβιον</ins>, but only the
swineherds and the shepherds, and the men in the fields. Polyphemus
used the cissybium, and Eum&aelig;us the other kind." But Callimachus
seems to make a blunder in the use of these names, speaking of an
intimate friend of his
who was entertained with him at a banquet by Pollis the Athenian, for
he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 761]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
For he abhorr'd to drink at one long draught<br />
Th' amystis loved in Thrace, not drawing breath:<br />
And soberly preferr'd a small cissybium:<br />
And when for the third time the cup (<ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>) went round,<br />
I thus address'd him . . . . . .
</div>

<p>For, as he here calls the same cup both <ins title="Greek: kissybion">κισσύβιον</ins> and <ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>, he
does not preserve the accurate distinction between the names. And
any one may conjecture that the <ins title="Greek: kissybion">κισσύβιον</ins> was originally made by the
shepherds out of the wood of the ivy (<ins title="Greek: kissos">κισσός</ins>). But some derive it from
the verb <ins title="Greek: cheumai">χεύμαι</ins>, used in the same sense as <ins title="Greek: chôreô">χωρέω</ins>, to contain; as it
occurs in the following line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This threshold shall contain (<ins title="Greek: cheisetai">χείσεται</ins>) them both.
</div>

<p>And the hole of the serpent is also called <ins title="Greek: cheiê">χείη</ins>, as containing the
animal; and they also give the name of <ins title="Greek: kêthion">κήθιον</ins>, that is, <ins title="Greek: chêtion">χήτιον</ins>, to the
box which holds the dice. And Dionysius of Samos, in his treatise on
the Cyclic Poets, calls the cup which Homer calls <ins title="Greek: kissybion">κισσύβιον</ins>, <ins title="Greek: kymbion">κύμβιον</ins>,
writing thus—"And Ulysses, when he saw him acting thus, having filled a
<ins title="Greek: kymbion">κύμβιον</ins> with wine, gave it to him to drink."</p>

<p>54. There is also the ciborium. Hegesander the Delphian says that
Euphorion the poet, when supping with the Prytanis, when the Prytanis
exhibited to him some ciboria, which appeared to be made in a most
exquisite and costly manner, . . . . . . . . And when the cup had gone round
pretty often, he, having drunk very hard and being intoxicated, took
one of the ciboria and defiled it. And Didymus says that it is a kind
of drinking-cup; and perhaps it may be the same as that which is called
scyphium, which derives its name from being contracted to a narrow
space at the bottom, like the Egyptian ciboria.</p>

<p>55. There is also the condu, an Asiatic cup. Menander, in his play
entitled the Flatterer, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then, too, there is in Cappadocia,<br />
O Struthion, a noble golden cup,<br />
Call'd condu, holding ten full cotyl&aelig;.
</div>

<p>And Hipparchus says, in his Men Saved,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Why do you so attend to this one soldier?</span><br />
He has no silver anywhere, I know well;<br />

<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Away with you, you wretch.</span><br />
<span class="linespace10_5"><i>A.</i> And then he has</span><br />
A condu, a wine-cooler, and a cymbium.
</div>

<p>And Nicomachus, in the first book of his treatise on the
Egyptian Festivals, says&mdash;"But the condu is a Persian cup;
and it was first introduced by Hermippus the astrologer.<a
name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"> </a><a href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> . . . . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . on

first book of his Conchoreis, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But he first pour'd libations to the gods<br />
From a large silver condu; then he rose,<br />
And straight departed by another road.
</div>

<p>There is also the cononius. Ister, the pupil of Callimachus, in the
first book of his History of Ptolemais, the city in Egypt, writes
thus:&mdash;"A pair of cups, called cononii, and a pair of thericlean cups
with golden covers.</p>

<p>56. There is also the cotylus. The cotylus is a cup with one handle,
which is also mentioned by Alc&aelig;us. But Diodorus, in his book addressed
to Lycophoron, says that this cup is greatly used by the Sicyonians and
Tarentines, and that it is like a deep luterium, and sometimes it has
an ear. And Ion the Chian also mentions it, speaking of "a cotylus full
of wine." And Hermippus, in his Gods, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He brought a cotylus first, a pledge for his neighbours.
</div>

<p>And Plato, in his Jupiter Afflicted, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He brings a cotylus.
</div>

<p>Aristophanes also, in his Babylonians, mentions the cotylus; and
Eubulus, in his Ulysses, or the Panopt&aelig;, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the priest utt'ring well-omen'd prayers,<br />
Stood in the midst, and in a gorgeous dress,<br />
Pour'd a libation from the cotylus.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 763]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>And Pamphilus says that it is a kind of cup, and peculiar to Bacchus.
But Polemo, in his treatise on the Fleece of the Sheep sacrificed to
Jupiter, says&mdash;"And after this he celebrates a sacrifice, and takes the
sacred fleece out of its shrine, and distributes it among all those who
have borne the cernus in the procession: and this is a vessel made of
earthenware, having a number of little cups glued to it; and in these
little
cups there is put sage, and white poppies, and ears of wheat, and
grains of barley, and peas, and pulse, and rye, and lentils, and beans,
and vetches, and bruised figs, and chaff, and oil, and honey, and milk,
and wine, and pieces of unwashed sheep's-wool. And he who has carried
this cernus eats of all these things, like the man who has carried the
mystic fan."</p>

<p>57. There is also the cotyle. Aristophanes, in his Cocalus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And other women, more advanced in age,<br />
Into their stomachs pour'd, without restraint,<br />
From good-sized cotyl&aelig;, dark Thasian wine,<br />
The whole contents of a large earthen jar,<br />
Urged by their mighty love for the dark wine.
</div>

<p>And Silenus, and Clitarchus, and also Zenodotus, say that it is a kind
of <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>, and say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And all around the corpse the black blood flow'd,<br />
As if pour'd out from some full cotyle.
</div>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is many a slip<br />
'Twixt the cup (<ins title="Greek: kotylês">κοτύλης</ins>) and the lip.
</div>

<p>And Simaristus says that it is a very small-sized cup which is called
by this name; and Diodorus says that the poet has here called the cup
by the name of cotyle, which is by others called cotylus, as where we
find&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<ins title="Greek: pyrnon">πύρνον</ins> (bread) <ins title="Greek: kai kotylên">καὶ κοτύλην</ins>;
</div>

<p>and that it is not of the class <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>, for that it has no
handles, but that it is very like a deep luterium, and a kind of
drinking cup (<ins title="Greek: potêriou">ποτηρίου</ins>); and that it is the same as that which
by the &AElig;tolians, and by some tribes of the Ionians, is called cotylus,
which is like those which have been already described, except that it
has only one ear: and Crates mentions it in his Sports, and Hermippus
in his Gods. But the Athenians give the name of <ins title="Greek: kotylê">κοτύλη</ins> to a
certain measure. Thucydides says&mdash;"They gave to each of them provisions
for eight months, at the rate of a cotyla of water and two cotyl&aelig; of
corn a-day." Aristophanes, in his Proagon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And having bought three ch&oelig;nixes of meal,<br />
All but one cotyla, he accounts for twenty.
</div>

<p>But Apollodorus says that it is a kind of cup, deep and hollow; and
he says&mdash;"The ancients used to call everything that was hollow
<ins title="Greek: kotylê">κοτύλη</ins>, as, for instance, the hollow of the hand; on which account we
find the expression <ins title="Greek: kotylêryton haima">κοτολήρυτον αἷμα</ins> meaning,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 764]</span>

blood in such quantities that it could be taken up in the hand. And
there was a game called <ins title="Greek: enkotylê">ἐγκοτύλη</ins>, in which those who are
defeated make their hands hollow, and then take hold of the knees of
those who have won the game and carry them." And Diodorus, in his
Italian Dialects, and Heraclitus (as Pamphilus says), relate that
the cotyla is also called hemina, quoting the following passage of
Epicharmus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then to drink a double measure,<br />
Two hemin&aelig; of tepid water full.
</div>

<p>And Sophron says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Turn up the hemina, O boy.
</div>

<p>But Pherecrates calls it a cotylisca, in his Corianno, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The cotylisca? By no means.
</div>

<p>And Aristophanes, in his Acharnians, uses a still more diminutive form,
and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A cotyliscium (<ins title="Greek: kotyliskion">κοτυλίσκιον</ins>) with a broken lip.
</div>

<p>And even the hollow of the hip is called <ins title="Greek: kotylê">κοτύλη</ins>; and the excrescences
on the feelers of the polypus are, by a slight extension of the word,
called <ins title="Greek: kotylêdôn">κοτυληδών</ins>. And &AElig;schylus, in his Edonians, has called cymbals
also <ins title="Greek: kotylai">κότυλαι</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And he makes music with his brazen <ins title="Greek: kotylai">κότυλαι</ins>.
</div>

<p>But Marsyas says that the bone of the hip is also called <ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins> and
<ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>. And the sacred bowl of Bacchus is called <ins title="Greek: kotyliskos">κοτυλίσκος</ins>; and so are
those goblets which the initiated use for their libations; as Nicander
of Thyatira says, adducing the following passage from the Clouds of
Aristophanes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Nor will I crown the cotyliscus.
</div>

<p>And Simmias interprets the word <ins title="Greek: kotylê">κοτύλη</ins> by <ins title="Greek: aleison">ἄλεισον</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 765]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>58. There is also the cottabis. Harmodius of Lepreum, in his treatise
on the Laws and Customs of Phigalea, going through the entertainments
peculiar to different countries, writes as follows:&mdash;"When they have
performed all these purificatory ceremonies, a small draught is
offered to each person to drink in a cottabis of earthenware; and he
who offers it says, 'May you sup well.'" But Hegesander the Delphian,
in his Commentaries (the beginning of which is "In the best Form
of Government"), says&mdash;"That which is called the cottabus has been
introduced into entertainments, the Sicilians (as Dic&aelig;archus relates)
having been the first people to introduce it. And such great fondness
was exhibited
for this amusement, that men even introduced into entertainments
contests, which were called cottabian games; and then cups of the
form which appeared to be most suitable for such an exercise were
made, called cottabides. And besides all this, rooms were built of
a round figure, in order that all, the cottabus being placed in the
middle, might contest the victory, all being at an equal distance, and
in similar situations. For they vied with one another, not only in
throwing their liquor at the mark, but also in doing everything with
elegance; for a man was bound to lean on his left elbow, and, making a
circuit with his right hand, to throw his drops (<ins title="Greek: tên lataga">τὴν λάταγα</ins>)
over gently&mdash;for that was the name which they gave to the liquor which
fell from the cup: so that some prided themselves more on playing
elegantly at the cottabus than others did on their skill with the
javelin."</p>

<p>59. There is also the cratanium. But perhaps this is the same cup,
under an ancient name, as that which is now called the craneum:
accordingly, Polemo (or whoever it is who wrote the treatise on the
Manners and Customs of the Greeks), speaking of the temple of the
Metapontines which is at Olympia, writes as follows:&mdash;"The temple of
the Metapontines, in which there are a hundred and thirty-two silver
phial&aelig;, and two silver wine-jars, and a silver apothystanium, and three
gilt phial&aelig;. The temple of the Byzantians, in which there is a figure
of Triton, made of cypress-wood, holding a silver cratanium, a silver
siren, two silver carchesia, a silver culix, a golden wine-jar, and two
horns. But in the old temple of Juno, there are thirty silver phial&aelig;,
two silver cratania, a silver dish, a golden apothystanium, a golden
crater (the offering of the Cyren&aelig;ans), and a silver batiacium."</p>

<p>There is also the crounea. Epigenes, in his Monument, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Crateres, cadi, holcia, crounea,</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Are these crounea?</span><br />
<span class="linespace6_75"><i>A.</i> Yes, indeed these are.</span>
</div>

<p>There is the cyathis also. This is a vessel with a great resemblance to
the cotyla. Sophron, in his play entitled the Buffoon, represents the
women who profess to exhibit the goddess as present, as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Three sovereign antidotes for poison<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 766]</span>

Are buried in a single cyathis.
</div>

<p>60. Then there is the <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>. Pherecrates, in his Slave-Tutor,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now wash the <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins> out; I'll give you then<br />
Some wine to drink: put o'er the cup a strainer,<br />
And then pour in some wine.
</div>

<p>But the <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins> is a drinking-cup made of earthenware, and it is so
called from being made circular (<ins title="Greek: apo tou kyliesthai">ἀπὸ τοῦ κυλίεσθαι</ins>) by the potter's
wheel; from which also the <ins title="Greek: kylikeion">κυλικεῖον</ins>, the place in which the cups are
stored up, gets its name, even when the cups put away in it are made
of silver. There is also the verb <ins title="Greek: kylikêgoreô">κυλικηγορέω</ins>, derived from the same
source, when any one makes an harangue over his cups But the Athenians
also call a medicine chest <ins title="Greek: kylikis">κυλικὶς</ins>, because it is made round in a
turning-lathe. And the <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins>, both at Argos and at Athens, were in
great repute; and Pindar mentions the Attic <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins> in the following
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O Thrasybulus, now I send<br />
This pair of pleasantly-meant odes<br />
As an after-supper entertainment for you.<br />
May it, I pray, be pleasing<br />
To all the guests, and may it be a spur<br />
To draw on cups of wine,<br />
And richly-fill'd Athenian <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins>.
</div>

<p>61. But the Argive <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins> appear to have been of a different
shape from the Athenian ones. At all events, they tapered towards a
point at the brims, as Simonides of Amorgos says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But this is taper-brimm'd (<ins title="Greek: phoxicheilos">φοξίχειλος</ins>),
</div>

<p>that is to say, drawn up to a point towards the top; such as those
which are called <ins title="Greek: ambikes">ἄμβικες</ins>. For they use the word <ins title="Greek: phoxos">φοξὸς</ins> in this sense, as Homer
does when speaking of Thersites&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
His head was sharp at top.
</div>

<p>And the word is equivalent to <ins title="Greek: phaoxos">φαοξὸς</ins>,—it being perceived to be sharp
(<ins title="Greek: oxys">ὀξὺς</ins>) in the part where the eyes (<ins title="Greek: ta phaê">τὰ φάη</ins>) are.</p>

<p>And very exquisitely wrought <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins> are made at Naucratis,
the native place of our companion Athen&aelig;us. For some are in the form
of phial&aelig;, not made in a lathe, but formed by hand, and having four
handles, and being widened considerably towards the bottom: (and there
are a great many potters at Naucratis, from whom the gate nearest to
the potteries (<ins title="Greek: kerameiôn">κεραμείων</ins>) is called the Ceramic gate:) and
they are dyed in such a manner as to appear like silver. The
Chian <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins> also are highly extolled, which Hermippus
mentions in his Soldiers&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 767]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
And a Chian <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins> hung on a peg aloft.
</div>

<p>But Glaucon, in his Dialects, says that the inhabitants of Cyprus call
the cotyle culix. And Hipponax, in his Synonymes, writes thus—"The
aleisum, the poterium, the cupellum, the amphotis, the scyphus, the
culix, the cothon, the carchesium, the phiale." Alcmæon, instead of
<ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins>, has lengthened the word, and written <ins title="Greek: kylichnides">κυλιχνίδες</ins>, in these
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But it is best to bring, as soon as possible,<br />
Dark wine, and one large common bowl for all,<br />
And some <ins title="Greek: kylichnides">κυλιχνίδες</ins> besides
</div>

<p>And Alc&aelig;us says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let us at once sit down and drink our wine,<br />
Why do we wait for lights? Our day is but<br />
A finger's span. Bring forth large goblets (<ins title="Greek: kylichnai">κύλιχναι</ins>) now<br />
Of various sorts. For the kind liberal son<br />
Of Jove and Semele gave rosy wine,<br />
Which bids us all forget our griefs and cares;<br />
So pour it forth, and mix in due proportion.
</div>

<p>And in his tenth Ode he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Drops of wine (<ins title="Greek: latages">λάταγες</ins>) fly from Teian culichnæ,
</div>

<p>showing, by this expression, that the <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins> of Teos were exceedingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>62. Pherecrates also says, in his Corianno&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> For I am coming almost boil'd away</span><br />
From the hot bath; my throat is parch'd and dry;<br />

Not long ago, some medicine. Take this cup<br />

</div>

<p>And that the women were in the habit of using large cups, Pherecrates
himself expressly tells us in his Tyranny, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then they bade the potter to prepare<br />
Some goblets for the men, of broader shape,<br />
Having no walls, but only a foundation,<br />
And scarcely holding more than a mere shell.<br />
More like to tasting cups; but for themselves<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 768]</span>

They order good deep <ins title="Greek: kylikes">κύλικες</ins>, good-sized,<br />
Downright wine-carrying transports, wide and round,<br />
Of delicate substance, swelling in the middle.<br />
A crafty order: for with prudent foresight<br />
They were providing how, without much notice,<br />
They might procure the largest quantity<br />

Reproach them that 'tis they who've drunk up everything,<br />
They heap abuse on us, and swear that they,<br />
Poor injured dears, have only drunk one cup,<br />
Though their one's larger than a thousand common cups.
</div>

<p>63. Then there are cymbia. These are a small hollow kind of cup,
according to Simaristus. But Dorotheus says, "The cymbium is a kind
of deep cup, upright, having no pedestal and no handles." But Ptolemy
the father of Aristonicus calls them "curved goblets." And Nicander
of Thyatira says that Theopompus, in his Mede, called a cup without
handles cymbium. Philemon, in his Vision, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But when fair Rhode came and shook above you<br />
A cymbium full of mighty unmix'd wine.
</div>

<p>But Dionysius of Samos, in the sixth book of his treatise on the Cyclic
Poets, thinks that the <ins title="Greek: kissybion">κισσύβιον</ins> and the <ins title="Greek: kymbion">κύμβιον</ins> are the same. For he says that
Ulysses, having filled a cymbium with
unmixed wine, gave it to the Cyclops. But the cup mentioned in Homer,
as having been given to him by Ulysses, is a good-sized cissybium;
for if it had been a small cup, he, who was so enormous a monster,
would not have been so quickly overcome by drunkenness, when he had
only drunk it three times. And Demosthenes mentions the cymbium in his
oration against Midias, saying that he was accompanied by rhyta and
cymbia: and in his orations against Euergus and Mnesibulus. But Didymus
the grammarian says that is a cup of an oblong shape, and narrow in
figure, very like the shape of a boat. And Anaxandrides, in his Clowns,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Perhaps large cups (<ins title="Greek: potêria">ποτήρια</ins>) immoderately drain'd,<br />
And cymbia full of strong unmixed wine,<br />
Have bow'd your heads, and check'd your usual spirit.
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Knight, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Had then those cymbia the faces of damsels</span><br />

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>64. But Eratosthenes, in his letter addressed to Ageton the
Laced&aelig;monian, says, that the cymbium is a vessel of the shape of the
cyathus, writing thus&mdash;"But these men marvel how a man who had not got
a cyathus, but only a cymbium, had, besides that, also a phiale. Now it
seems to me, that he had one for the use of men, but the other for the
purpose of doing honour to the Gods. And at that time they never used
the cyathus nor the cotyla. For they used to employ, in the sacrifices
of the Gods, a crater, not made of silver nor inlaid with precious
stones, but made of Coliad clay. And as often as they replenished this,
pouring a libation to the Gods out of the phiale, they then poured out
wine to all the company in order, bailing out the newly-mixed wine in
a cymbium, as they do now among us at the phiditia. And if ever they
wished to drink more, they also placed on the table beside them the
cups called cotyli, which are the most beautiful of all cups, and the
most convenient to drink out of. And these, too, were all made of the
same earthenware." But when Ephippus says, in his Ephebi&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Ch&aelig;remon brings no culices to supper,<br />
Nor did Euripides with cymbia fight,
</div>

<p>he does not mean the tragic poet, but some namesake of his, who was
either very fond of wine, or who had an evil reputation on some other
account, as Antiochus of Alexandria says, in his treatise on the Poets,
who are ridiculed by the comic writers of the Middle Comedy. For the
circumstance of cymbia being introduced into entertainments, and being
used to fight with in drunken quarrels, bears on each point. And
Anaxandrides mentions him in his Nereids&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Give him a choeus then of wine, O messmate,<br />

Then rising, all with goblets (<ins title="Greek: kypellois">κυπέλλοις</ins>) in their hands,<br />
The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands<br />
Hail'd their return.
</div>

<p>Or was their form different also? For this kind has not the character
of the amphicupellum, as the depas and aleison have, but is only of
a curved form. For the <ins title="Greek: kypellon">κύπελλον</ins> is so called from its curved shape,
as also is the <ins title="Greek: amphikypellon">ἀμφικύπελλον</ins>. Or is it so called as being in shape
like a milk-pail (<ins title="Greek: pella">πέλλα</ins>), only contracted a little, so as to have an
additional curve? And the word <ins title="Greek: amphikypella">ἀμφικύπελλα</ins> is equivalent to <ins title="Greek: amphikyrta">ἀμφίκυρτα</ins>,
being so called from its handles, because they are of a curved shape.
For the poet calls this cup&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Golden, two-handled.
</div>

<p>But Antimachus, in the fifth book of his Thebais, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And heralds, going round among the chiefs,<br />
Gave each a golden cup (<ins title="Greek: kypellon">κύπελλον</ins>) with labour wrought.
</div>

<p>And Silenus says, the <ins title="Greek: kypella">κύπελλα</ins> are a kind of cup resembling the <ins title="Greek: skypha">σκύφα</ins>,
as Nicander the Colophonian says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The swineherd gave a goblet (<ins title="Greek: kypellon">κύπελλον</ins>) full to each.
</div>

<p>And Eumolpus says that it is a kind of cup, so called from its being
of a curved shape (<ins title="Greek: kyphon">κυφόν</ins>). But Simaristus says that this
is a name given by the Cyprians to a cup with two handles, and by
the Cretans to a kind of cup with two handles, and to another with
four. And Philetas says that the Syracusans give the name of <ins title="Greek: kypellon">κύπελλον</ins>
to the fragments of barley-cakes and loaves which are left on
the tables.</p>

<p>There is also the <ins title="Greek: kymbê">κύμβη</ins>. Philemon, in his Attic Dialect, calls it “a
species of <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>.” And Apollodorus, in his treatise on Etymologies,
says, that the Paphians call a drinking-cup <ins title="Greek: kymba">κύμβα</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 771]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS</div>

<p>66. Then there is the <ins title="Greek: kôthôn">κωθων</ins>, which is mentioned by Xenophon,
in the first book of his Cyrop&aelig;dia. But Critias, in his Constitution of
the Laced&aelig;monians, writes as follows&mdash;"And other small things besides
which belong to human life; such as the Laced&aelig;monian shoes, which are
the best, and the Laced&aelig;monian garments, which are the most pleasant to
wear, and the most useful. There is also the Laced&aelig;monian
<ins title="Greek: kôthôn">κωθων</ins>, which is a kind of drinking-cup most convenient when
one is on an expedition, and the most easily carried in a knapsack.
And the reason why it is so peculiarly well-suited to a soldier is,
because a soldier often is forced to drink water which is not very
clean; and, in the first place, this cup is not one in which it can be
very easily seen what one is drinking; and, secondly, as its brim is
rather curved inwards, it is likely to retain what is not quite clean
in it." And Polemo, in his work addressed to Ad&aelig;us and Antigonus, says
that the Laced&aelig;monians used to use vessels made of earthenware; and
proceeds to say further&mdash;"And this was a very common practice among the
ancients, such as is now adopted in some of the Greek tribes. At Argos,
for instance, in the public banquets, and in Laced&aelig;mon, they drink out
of cups made of earthenware at the festivals, and in the feasts in
honour of victory, and at the marriage-feasts of their maidens. But
at other banquets and at their Phiditia<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
they use small casks." And Archilochus also mentions the cothon as a
kind of cup, in his Elegies, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But come now, with your cothon in your hand,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Move o'er the benches of the speedy ship,</span><br />
And lift the covers from the hollow casks,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And drain the rosy wine down to the dregs;</span><br />
For while we're keeping such a guard as this,<br />
<span class="linespace1">We shan't be able to forego our wine;</span>
</div>

<p>as if the <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins> were here called <ins title="Greek:">κώθων</ins>.
Aristophanes, in his Knights, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They leapt into th' horse-transports gallantly,<br />
Buying cothones; but some bought instead<br />
Garlic and onions.
</div>

<p>And Heniochus, in his Gorgons, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Let a man give me wine to drink at once,<br />
Taking that capital servant of the throat,<br />
The ample cothon,&mdash;fire-wrought, and round,<br />
Broad-ear'd, wide-mouth'd.
</div>

<p>And Theopompus, in his Female Soldiers, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Shall I, then, drink from out a wryneck'd cothon,<br />
Breaking my own neck in the hard attempt?
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 772]</span></p>

<p>And Alexis, in his Spinners, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then he hurl'd a four-pint cothon at me,<br />
An ancient piece of plate, an heirloom too.
</div>

<p>And it is from this cup that they call those who drink a great deal of
unmixed wine (<ins title="Greek: akraton">ὐκράτον</ins>)<ins title="Greek: akratokôthônes">ἀκρτοκώθωνες</ins>, as Hyperides
does in his oration against Demosthenes. But Callixenus, in the
fourth book of his History of Alexandria, giving an account of the
procession of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and giving a catalogue of a number
of drinking-cups, adds these words: "And two cothons, each holding two
measures of wine."</p>

<p>67. But with respect to drinking, (which from the name of this kind of
cup is sometimes called in the verb <ins title="Greek: kôthônizomai">κωθωνίζομαι</ins>, and in the
substantive <ins title="Greek: kôthônismos">κωθωνισμὸς</ins>,) that occasional drinking is good
for the health is stated by Mnesitheus the Athenian physician, in his
letter on the subject of Drinking (<ins title="Greek: kôthônismos">κωθωνισμὸς</ins>), where he
speaks as follows: "It happens that those who drink a great quantity of
unmixed wine at banquets often receive great injury from so doing, both
in their bodies and minds; but still occasional hard drinking (<ins title="Greek: kôthônizesthai">κωθωνιζεσθαι</ins>)
for some days appears to me to produce a certain
purging of the body and a certain relaxation of the mind. For there are
some little roughnesses on the surface, arising from daily banquets;
now for getting rid of these there is no easier channel than the wine.
But of all modes of purging, that which is caused by hard drinking
is the most advantageous; for then the body is as it were washed out
by the wine; for the wine is both liquid and heating: but the wine
which we secrete is harsh; accordingly, fullers use it as a cleanser
when they are cleaning garments. But when you are drinking hard, you
should guard against three things,&mdash;against drinking bad wine, against
drinking unmixed wine, and against eating sweetmeats while you are
drinking. And when you have had enough, then do not go to sleep, until
you have had a vomit, moderate or copious as the case may be; and when
you have vomited, then go to sleep after having taken a slight bath.
And if you are not able to empty yourself sufficiently, then you must
take a more copious bath, and lie down in the bath in exceedingly warm
water." But Polemo, in the fifth book of his treatise addressed to
Antigonus and Ad&aelig;us, says&mdash;"Bacchus being full grown, sitting
on a rock, and on his left hand a satyr, bald, holding in his right
hand a cothon of striped colours, with one handle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 773]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS</div>

<p>68. There is also the labronia. This is a species of Persian
drinking-cup, so named from the eagerness (<ins title="Greek: labrotês">λαβρότης</ins>) with
which people drink: and its shape is wide, and its size large, and it
has large handles. Menander, in his Fisherman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We are abundantly well off at this time<br />
For golden cylinders; and all those robes<br />
From Persia, all those quaintly carved works,<br />
Are now within, and richly-chased goblets,<br />
Figures and faces variously carved,<br />
Tragelaphi and labronia.
</div>

<p>And in his Philadelphi he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now the drinking of healths began, and now<br />
Labroni&aelig;, inlaid with precious stones,<br />
Were set upon the board; and slaves stood round<br />
With Persian fly-flappers.
</div>

<p>And Hipparchus, in his Thais, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But this labronius is an omen now.<br />
O Hercules! it is a cup which weighs<br />
Of standard gold more than two hundred pieces.<br />
Just think, my friend, of this superb labronius.
</div>

<p>And Diphilus, in his Pithraustes, giving a catalogue of other kinds of
cups, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> The tragelaphus, and likewise the pristis,</span><br />
The batiace, and labronius too.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> These seem to me to be the names of slaves.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> By no means; they are all the names of cups;</span><br />
And this labronius is worth twenty pieces.
</div>

<p>And Didymus says that it resembles the bombylium and the batiacium.</p>

<p>69. There is also the lac&aelig;na. And this is a kind of cup so called
either from the potter, as the Attic vessels usually are, or from the
form which is usual in that district, on the same principle as the
thericlean cups derive their name. Aristophanes, in his Daitaleis,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He gladly shared the Sybaritic feasts,<br />
And drank the Chian wine from out the cups<br />
Called the lac&aelig;n&aelig;, with a cheerful look.
</div>

<p>70. Then there is the lepaste. Some mark this word <ins title="Greek: lepastê">λεπαστη</ins> with an
acute accent on the last syllable, like <ins title="Greek: kale">καλή</ins>; but some mark the
penultima with an acute, as <ins title="Greek: megalê">μεγάλη</ins>. And this kind of cup derived its
name from those who spend a great deal of money on their drinking and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 774]</span>

intemperance, whom men call <ins title="Greek: laphyktai">λάφυκται</ins>. Aristophanes, in his Peace,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
What will you do, then, when you've drunk<br />
One single lepaste full of new wine?
</div>

<p>And it is from this word <ins title="Greek: lepastê">λεπαστὴ</ins> that the verb <ins title="Greek: laptô">λάπτω</ins> comes, which
means to swallow all at once, having a meaning just opposite to the
bombylium; for the same author says, somewhere or other,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You've drunk up all my blood, O king, my master!
</div>

<p>which is as much as to say, you have utterly drained me. And in his
Gerytades he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But there was then a festival: a slave<br />
Went round, and brought us all a lepaste,<br />
And pour'd in wine dark as the deep-blue sea;
</div>

<p>but the poet means here to indicate the depth of the cup. And
Antiphanes, in his &AElig;sculapius, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He took an agèd woman, who had been<br />
A long time ill, sick of a ling'ring fever,<br />
And bruising some small root, and putting it<br />
Into a noble-sized lepaste there,<br />
He made her drink it all, to cure her sickness.
</div>

<p>Philyllius, in his Auge, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For she was always in the company<br />
Of young men, who did nothing else but drink;<br />
And with a lot of aged women too,<br />
Who always do delight in good-sized cups.
</div>

<p>And Theopompus says in his Pamphila&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A sponge, a dish, a feather; and, besides,<br />
A stout lepaste, which, when full, they drain<br />
To the Good Deity, raising loud his praises,<br />
As chirps a grasshopper upon a tree.
</div>

<p>And in his Mede he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Callimachus, 'tis stated, once did charm<br />
The Grecian heroes by some promised gain,<br />
When he was seeking for their aid and friendship.<br />
The only thing he fail'd in was th' attempt<br />
To gain the poor, thin-bodied Rhadamanthus<br />
Lysander with a cothon, ere he gave him<br />
A full lepaste.
</div>

<p>But Amerias says that the ladle with which the wine is poured into
the cups is called lepaste; but Aristophanes and Apollodorus say that
it is a sort of cup of the class <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>. Pherecrates, in his
Crapatalli, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 775]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
If there was one of the spectators thirsty,<br />
He would a full lepaste seize, and drain<br />
The whole contents.
</div>

<p>But Nicander the Colophonian says that "the Dolopians give the name of
<ins title="Greek: lepastê">λεπαστὴ</ins> to the <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>; but Lycophron, in the ninth book of his treatise
on Comedy, quoting this passage of Pherecrates, himself also asserts
the lepaste to be kind of <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>; but Moschus, in his Interpretation of
Rhodiat Words, says that it is an earthenware vessel resembling those
which are called ptomatides, but flatter and wider: but Artemidorus,
the pupil of Aristophanes, says that it is some sort of drinking-cup.
And Apollophanes, in his Cretans, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the lepasta, fill'd with fragrant wine,<br />
Shall fill me with delight the livelong day.
</div>

<p>And Theopompus says in his Pamphila&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A stout lepaste, which, well-fill'd with wine,<br />
They drain in honour of the Happy Deity,<br />
Rousing the village with their noise and clamour.
</div>

<p>But Nicander of Thyatira says it is a larger kind of <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>,
quoting the expressions of Teleclides out of his Prytanes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To drink sweet wine from a sweet-smelling lepaste.
</div>

<p>And Hermippus, in his Fates, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
If anything should happen to me when<br />
I've drain'd this promising lepaste, then<br />
I give my whole possessions unto Bacchus.
</div>

<p>71. There is also the loibasium. This, too, is a <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>, as
Clearchus and Nicander of Thyatira say; with which they pour libations
of oil over the sacred offerings and victims.</p>

<p>Spondeum is the name given to the cup out of which they pour libations
of wine. And he says that the spondea are also called loibides, by
Antimachus of Colophon.</p>

<p>Then we have the lesbium. This also is a kind of cup, as Hedylus proves
in his Epigrams, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Callistion, contending against men<br />
<span class="linespace1">In drinking, ('tis a marvellous thing, but true,)</span><br />
When fasting, drank three whole choeis of wine;<br />
<span class="linespace1">And now her cup, fashion'd of purple glass,</span><br />
Adorn'd with bands fragrant of luscious wine,<br />
<span class="linespace1">She offers here to you, O Paphian queen.</span><br />
Preserve this first, that so your walls may bear<br />
<span class="linespace1">The spoils of all the love excited so.</span>
</div>

<p>There is also the luterium. Epigenes, in his Tomb, where he gives a
catalogue of cups of different kinds, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 776]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
Crateres, cadi, holcia, cruneia&mdash;<br />
Are they cruneia? aye, and luteria.<br />
But why need I each separate article<br />
Enumerate? for you yourself shall see them.
</div>

<p>72. There is also the Lyciurges. The things which are so called are
some kinds of phial&aelig;, which derive their name from Lycon who made them,
just as the Cononii are the cups made by Conon. Now, Demosthenes, in
his Oration for the Crown, mentions Lycon; and he does so again, in
his oration against Timotheus for an assault, where he says&mdash;"Two
lyciurgeis phial&aelig;." And in his speech against Timotheus he also
says&mdash;"He gives Phormion, with the money, also two lyciurgeis phial&aelig;
to put away." And Didymus the grammarian says that these are cups made
by Lycius. And this Lycius was a B&oelig;otian by birth, of the town of
Eleuther&aelig;, a son of Myron the sculptor, as Polemo relates in the first
book of his treatise on the Acropolis of Athens; but the grammarian
is ignorant that one could never find such a formation of a word as
that derived from proper names, but only from cities or nations. For
Aristophanes, in his Peace, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The vessel is a <ins title="Greek: Naxiourgês">Nαξιονργὴς</ins> cantharus;
</div>

<p>that is to say, made at Naxos.</p>

<p>And Critias, in his Constitution of the Lacedæmonians, has the
expressions, <ins title="Greek: klinê Milêsiourgês">κλίνη μιλησιουργὴς</ins>, and again, <ins title="Greek: diphros Milêsiourgês">δίφρος λησιουργής</ins>: and
<ins title="Greek: klinê Chiourgês">κλινὴ χιουργὴς</ins>, and <ins title="Greek: trapeza Rhênioergês">τράπεξα ρηνιοεργής</ins>: made at Miletus, or Chios, or
Rhenea. And Herodotus, in his seventh book, speaks of “two spears,
<ins title="Greek: Lykoergees">λυκοεργέες</ins>.” But perhaps we ought to read <ins title="Greek: Lykioergees">λυκιοεργέες</ins> in Herodotus as
we do in Demosthenes, so as to understand by the word things made in
Lycia.</p>

<p>73. There is also the mele. This is a name given to some cups which are
mentioned by Anaxippus in his Well, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And you, Syriscus, now this mele take,<br />
And bring it to her tomb&mdash;do you understand?<br />
Then pour a due libation.
</div>

<p>There is also the metaniptrum. This is the kind of cup which is offered
after dinner, when men have washed their hands. Antiphanes, in his
Lamp, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The metaniptrum of the Fortunate God;<br />
Feasting, libations, and applause . . .
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 777]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>And Diphilus, in his Sappho, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Archilochus, receive this metaniptris,<br />
The brimming cup of Jupiter the Saviour.
</div>

<p>But some people say that this is rather the name of the draught itself
which was given to the guests after they had washed their hands; as,
for instance, Seleucus says in his Dialects. But Callias, in his
Cyclops, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Receive this metaniptris of Hygeia.
</div>

<p>And Philet&aelig;rus, in his &AElig;sculapius, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He raised aloft a mighty metaniptris,<br />
Brimfull of wine, in equal portions mix'd,<br />
Repeating all the time Hygeia's name.
</div>

<p>And Philoxenus the Dithyrambic poet, in his ode entitled the Supper,
pledging some one after they have washed their hands, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Do you, my friend, receive<br />
<span class="linespace1">This metaniptris full of wine,</span><br />
The sweetly dewy gift of Bacchus.<br />
<span class="linespace1">Bromius gives this placid joy,</span><br />
To lead all men to happiness.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Torch, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Our table shall now be this barley-cake,<br />
And then this metaniptrum of Good Fortune . . . . .
</div>

<p>Nicostratus, in his Woman returning Love, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pour over him the metaniptrum of health.
</div>

<p>74. Then there is the mastus. Apollodorus the Cyren&aelig;an, as Pamphilus
says, states that this is a name given to drinking-cups by the Paphians.</p>

<p>There are also the mathalides. Bl&aelig;sus, in his Saturn, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Pour out for us now seven mathalides<br />
Full of sweet wine.
</div>

<p>And Pamphilus says, “Perhaps this is a kind of cup, or is it only a
measure like the cyathus” But Diodorus calls it a cup of the <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>
class.</p>

<p>75. There is also the manes, which is a species of cup. Nicon, in his
Harp-player, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And some seasonably then exclaim'd,<br />
My fellow-countryman, I drink to you;<br />
And in his hand he held an earthenware manes,<br />
Of ample size, well able to contain<br />
Five cotyl&aelig; of wine; and I received it.
</div>

<p>And both Didymus and Pamphilus have quoted these iambics. But that is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 778]</span>
also called manes which stands upon the cottabus, on which they throw
the drops of wine in that game, which Sophocles, in his Salmoneus,
called the brazen head, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This is a contest, and a noise of kisses;<br />
I give a prize to him who gains the victory<br />
In elegantly throwing the cottabus,<br />
And striking with just aim the brazen head.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Birthday of Venus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> I then will show you how: whoever throws</span><br />
The cottabus direct against the scale (<ins title="Greek: plastinx">πλάστιγξ</ins>),<br />
So as to make it fall&mdash;<br />
<span class="linespace8_5"><i>B.</i> What scale? Do you</span><br />
Mean this small dish which here is placed above?<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> That is the scale&mdash;he is the conqueror.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> How shall a man know this?</span><br />
<span class="linespace10_5"><i>A.</i> Why, if he throw</span><br />
So as to reach it barely, it will fall<br />
Upon the manes,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
and there'll be great noise.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Does manes, then, watch o'er the cottabus,</span><br />
As if he were a slave?
</div>

<p>And Hermippus says in his Fates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You'll see, says he, a cottabus rod,<br />
Wallowing round among the chaff;<br />
But the manes hears no drops,&mdash;<br />
And you the wretched scale may see<br />
Lying by the garden gate,<br />
And thrown away among the rubbish.
</div>

<p>76. There is the Nestoris also. Now concerning the shape of the cup of
Nestor, the poet speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Next her white hand a spacious goblet brings,<br />
A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings<br />
From eldest times; the massy, sculptured vase,<br />
Glittering with golden studs, four handles grace,<br />
And curling vines, around each handle roll'd,<br />
Support two turtle-doves emboss'd in gold.<br />
On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl,<br />
Lest the topweight should make it loosely roll:<br />
A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,<br />
Though all too great for men of lesser limb.
</div>

<p>Now with reference to this passage a question is raised, what is the
meaning of "glittering with golden studs:"&mdash;and again, what is meant by
"the massy, sculptured vase four handles grace." For Asclepiades the
Myrlean, in his treatise on the Nestoris, says that the other cups have
two handles.</p>

<p>And again, how could any one give a representation of turtle-doves
feeding around each of the handles? How also can he say, "On two
firm bases stood the mighty bowl?" And this also is a very peculiar
statement that he makes, that he could heave it with ease, "though all
too great for men of lesser limb." Now Asclepiades proposes all these
difficulties, and especially raises the question about the studs, as to
how we are to understand that they were fastened on. Now some say that
golden studs must be fastened on a silver goblet from the outside, on
the principles of embossing, as is mentioned in the case of the sceptre
of Achilles&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He spoke,&mdash;and, furious, hurl'd against the ground<br />
His sceptre, starr'd with golden studs around;
</div>

<p>for it is plain here that the studs were let into the sceptre, as
clubs are strengthened with iron nails. He also says of the sword of
Agamemnon&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,<br />
Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:<br />
Gold were the studs&mdash;a silver sheath encased<br />
The shining blade.
</div>

<p>But Apelles the engraver, he says, showed us on some articles of
Corinthian workmanship the way in which studs were put on. For there
was a small projection raised up by the chisel, to form, as it were,
the heads of the nails. And these studs are said by the poet to be
fixed in, not because they are on the outside and are fixed by nails,
but because they resemble nails driven through, and project a little on
the outside, being above the rest of the surface.</p>

<p>77. And with respect to the handles, they tell us that this cup had
indeed two handles above, like other cups; but that it had also two
more on the middle of its convex surface, one on each side, of small
size, resembling the Corinthian water-ewers. But Apelles explained
the system of the four handles very artistically in the following
manner. He said, that from one root, as it were, which is attached
to the bottom of the cup, there are diverging lines extending along
each handle, at no great distance from each other: and these reach
up to the brim of the cup, and even rise a little above it, and are
at the greatest distance from each other at the point where they are
furthest from the vessel itself; but at the lower extremity, where
they join the rim, they are again united. And in this way there are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 780]</span>

four handles; but this kind of ornament is not seen in every cup, but
only on some, and especially on those which are called seleucides. But
with respect to the question raised about the two bases, how it can be
said, "On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl," some people explain
that line thus:&mdash;that some cups have one bottom, the natural one, being
wrought at the same time as, and of one piece with, the whole cup;
as for instance, those which are called cymbia, and the phial&aelig;, and
others of the same shape as the phial&aelig;. But some have two bottoms; as
for instance, the egg-shaped cups called ooscyphia, and those called
cantharia, and the seleucides, and the carchesia, and others of this
kind. For they say that one of these bottoms is wrought of the same
piece as the entire cup, and the other is attached to it, being sharp
at the upper part, and broader towards the lower end, as a support for
the cup; and this cup of Nestor's, they say, was of this fashion. But
the poet may have represented this cup as having two bottoms; the one,
that is to say, bearing the whole weight of the cup, and having an
elevation proportionate to the height, in accordance with its greater
circumference; and the other bottom might be smaller in circumference,
so as to be contained within the circumference of the larger circle,
where the natural bottom of the cup becomes sharper; so that the whole
cup should be supported on two bases.</p>

<p>But Dionysius the Thracian is said to have made the cup called
Nestor's, at Rhodes, all his pupils contributing silver for the work;
of which Promethidas of Heraclea, explaining the way in which it was
made on the system of Dionysius, says that it is a cup having its
handles made side by side, as the ships with two prows have their prows
made; and that turtle-doves are represented sitting on the handles;
and that two small sticks, as it were, are placed under the cup as a
support to it, running transversely across in a longitudinal direction,
and that these are the two bottoms meant by Homer. And we may to this
day see a cup of that fashion at Capua, a city of Campania, consecrated
to Diana; and the Capuans assert that that is the identical cup which
belonged to Nestor. And it is a silver cup, having on it the lines of
Homer engraved in golden characters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 781]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>78. "But I," said the Myrlean, "have this to say about
the cup:&mdash;the ancients, who first brought men over to a more civilized
system of life, believing that the world was spherical, and taking
their ideas of form from the visible forms of the sun and moon which
they beheld, and adapting these figures to their own use in the daily
concerns of life, thought it right to make all their vessels and other
articles of furniture resemble, in shape at least, the heaven which
surrounds everything: on which account they made tables round; and so
also they made the tripods which they dedicated to the Gods, and they
also made their cakes round and marked with stars, which they also call
moons. And this is the origin of their giving bread the name of <ins title="Greek: artos">ἄρτος</ins>,
because of all figures the circle is the one which is the most complete
(<ins title="Greek: apêrtistai">ἀπήρτισται</ins>), and it is a perfect figure. And accordingly they made a
drinking-cup, being that which receives moist nourishment, circular,
in imitation of the shape of the world. But the cup of Nestor has
something peculiar about it, for it has stars on it, which the poet
compares to studs, because the stars are as round as the studs,
and are, as it were, fixed in the heaven; as also Aratus says of
them&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There do they shine in heaven,&mdash;ornaments<br />
Fix'd there for ever as the night comes round.
</div>

<p>But the poet has expressed this very beautifully, attaching the golden
studs to the main body of the silver cup, and so indicating the nature
of the stars and of the heaven by the colour of the ornaments. For the
heaven is like silver, and the stars resemble gold from their fiery
colour.</p>

<p>79. "So after the poet had represented the cup of Nestor as studded
with stars, he then proceeds on to the most brilliant of the fixed
stars, by contemplating which men form their conjectures of what is to
happen to them in their lives. I mean the Pleiades. For when he says
<ins title="Greek: dyo de peleiades">δύο δὲ πελειάδες</ins> were placed in gold around each handle, he does not
mean the birds called <ins title="Greek: peleiades">πελειάδες</ins>, that is to say, turtle-doves; and
those who think that he does use <ins title="Greek: peleiades">πελειάδες</ins> here as synonymous with
<ins title="Greek: peristerai">περιστεραὶ</ins> are wrong. For Aristotle says expressly that the <ins title="Greek: peleias">πελειὰς</ins>
is one bird, and the <ins title="Greek: peristera">περιστερὰ</ins> another. But the poet calls that
constellation <ins title="Greek: peleiades">πελειάδες</ins> which at present w call <ins title="Greek: pleiades">πλειάδες</ins>; by the rising
of which men regulate their swing and their reaping, and the beginning
of their raising their crops, and their collection of them; as Hesiod
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 782]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
When the seven daughters of the Libyan king<br />
Rise in the heavens, then begin to mow;<br />
And when they hide their heads, then plough the ground.
</div>

<p>And Aratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Their size is small, their light but moderate,<br />
Yet are they famous over all the world;<br />
At early dawn and late at eve they roll,<br />
Jove regulating all their tranquil motions;<br />
He has ordain'd them to give signs to men,<br />
When winter, and when summer too begins,&mdash;<br />
What is the time for ploughing, what for sowing.
</div>

<p>And accordingly it is with great appropriateness that the poet has
represented the Pleiades, who indicate the time of the generation and
approach to perfection of the fruits of the earth, as forming parts of
the ornaments of the cup of that wise prince Nestor. For this vessel
was intended to contain any kind of food, whether solid or liquid; on
which account he also says that the turtle-doves bring ambrosia to
Jupiter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing,<br />
That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king,<br />
But shuns these rocks.
</div>

<p>For we must not think here that it is really the birds called
turtle-doves which bring ambrosia to Jupiter, which is the opinion of
many; for that were inconsistent with the majesty of Jupiter; but the
daughters of Atlas, turned into the constellation of Pleiades or doves.
For it is natural enough that they who indicate the appropriate seasons
to the human race should also bring ambrosia to Jupiter, on which
account also he distinguishes between them and other birds, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing;
</div>

<p>and that he considers the Pleiades as the most famous of all fixed
stars is plain, from his having placed them in the first rank when
giving a list of other constellations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd,&mdash;<br />
Th' unwearied sun, the moon completely round,&mdash;<br />
The starry lights, that heaven's high convex crown'd,&mdash;<br />
The Pleiades, Hyads, with the Northern Team,<br />
And great Orion's more refulgent beam;<br />
To which, around the axle of the sky,<br />
The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye;<br />
Still shines exalted on th' ethereal plain,<br />
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main,&mdash;<br />
The Bear, whom trusting rustics call the Wain.
</div>

<div class="sidenote-left">THE PLEIADES.</div>

<p>"But people in general have been deceived by fancying the <ins title="Greek: peleiades">πελειάδες</ins>
here spoken of to be birds, first of all from the poetical form of the
word, because of the insertion of the letter <ins title="Greek: e">ε</ins>; and secondly, because
they have taken the word <ins title="Greek: trêrônes">τρήρωνες</ins>, 'trembling,' as an epithet only of
doves; since, owing to its weakness, that is a very cautious bird; and
when he calls it <ins title="Greek: trêrôn">τρήρων</ins>, this word is derived from <ins title="Greek: treô">τρέω</ins>, and <ins title="Greek: treô">τρέω</ins> is
the same as <ins title="Greek: eulabeomai">εὐλαβέομαι</ins>, to be cautious. But still there is a good deal
of reason in attributing the same characteristic also to the Pleiades:
for the fable is, that they are always fleeing from Orion, since their
mother Pleione is constantly pursued by Orion.</p>

<p>80. "And the variation of the name, so that the Pleiades are called
both <ins title="Greek: Peleiai">πέλειαι</ins> and <ins title="Greek: Peleiades">πελειάδες</ins>, occurs in many poets. First of all, Myro
the Byzantian admirably caught the feeling of the Homeric poems,
saying in her poem entitled Memory, that the Pleiades convey ambrosia
to Jupiter. But Crates the critic, endeavouring to appropriate to
himself the credit due to her, produces that assertion as his own.
Simonides also has called the Pleiades <ins title="Greek: Peleiades">Πελειάδες</ins>, in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And may great Mercury, whose protecting pow'r<br />
Watches o'er contests, Maia's mighty son,<br />
Grant you success. But Atlas was the sire<br />
Of seven dark-hair'd daughters, beautiful,<br />
Surpassing all the maidens upon earth,<br />
And now in heaven they're call'd Peleiades.
</div>

<p>Here he distinctly calls the Pleiades <ins title="Greek: Peleiades">Πελειάδες</ins>, for they it
was who were the daughters of Atlas; as Pindar says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace7">And it is natural</span><br />
That great Orion should advance<br />
Not far from the seven Pleiades, at the tail (<ins title="Greek: opias">ὀρίας</ins>).
</div>

<p>For, in the arrangement of the stars, Orion is not far from the
Pleiades; from which circumstance has arisen the fable about them, that
they, with their mother Pleione, are always fleeing from Orion. But
when he calls the Pleiades <ins title="Greek: oriai">ὄριαι</ins> here, he means <ins title="Greek: ouriai">οὔριαι</ins>, only he has
left out the <ins title="Greek: u">v</ins>, because the Pleiades are close to the tail of the Bull.
And &AElig;schylus has spoken still more plainly, playing on their name on
account of the resemblance of its sound, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The seven celebrated daughters of<br />
The mighty Atlas, much bewail'd with tears<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 784]</span>

Their father's heaven-supporting toil; where they<br />
Now take the form of night-appearing visions,<br />
The wingless Peleiades.
</div>

<p>For he calls them here wingless on account of the similarity of the
sound of their name to that of the birds <ins title="Greek: Peleiades">Ππελειάδες</ins>. And Myro
herself also speaks in the same manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The mighty Jove was nourish'd long in Crete,<br />
Nor yet had any of the heav'nly beings<br />
E'er recognised their king; meanwhile he grew<br />
In all his limbs; and him the trembling doves<br />
Cherish'd, while hidden in the holy cave,<br />
Bringing him, from the distant streams of ocean,<br />
Divine ambrosia: and a mighty eagle,<br />
Incessant drawing with his curved beak<br />
Nectar from out the rock, triumphant brought<br />
The son of Saturn's necessary drink.<br />
Him, when the God of mighty voice had cast<br />
His father Saturn from his unjust throne,<br />
He made immortal, and in heaven placed.<br />
And so, too, did he give the trembling doves (<ins title="Greek: peleiasin">πελειάσιν</ins>)<br />
Deserved honour; they who are to men<br />
Winters and summer's surest harbingers.
</div>

<p>And Simmias, in his Gorgo, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The swiftest ministers of air came near,<br />
The quivering peleiades.
</div>

<p>And Posidippus, in his Asopia, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Nor do the evening cool <ins title="Greek: peleiai">πέλειαι</ins> set.
</div>

<p>But Lamprocles the Dithyrambic poet has also expressly and poetically
said that the word <ins title="Greek: peleiades">πελειάδες</ins> is in every sense synonymous with
<ins title="Greek: peristerai">περιστεραὶ</ins>, in the following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now you have your home in heaven,<br />
Showing your title with the winged doves.
</div>

<p>And the author of the poem called Astronomy, which is attributed to
Hesiod, always calls the Pleiades <ins title="Greek: Peleiades">Πελειάδες</ins>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Which mortals call Peleiades.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And now the Peleiades of winter set.
</div>

<p>And in another passage we find&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then the Peleiades do hide their heads;
</div>

<p>so that there is nothing at all improbable in the idea of Homer having

<p>81. "Since, then, it is demonstrated that it is the Pleiades
who were embossed on the goblet, we must understand that two were
affixed to each handle, whether we choose to fancy that the damsels
were represented under the form of birds or under human form;&mdash;at all
events they were studded with stars: and as for the expression, "Around
each there were golden peleiades," we are not to understand that as
meaning around each separate one; for that would make eight in number:
but as each of the handles was divided into two sections, and as these
again were united towards the bottom, the poet has the word ἕκαστος,
speaking as if there were four sections of handles; but if he had
said ἑκάτερον, that would have applied to the fact of their again
becoming united at the highest point which they respectively reach. And
accordingly, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And curling vines, around each handle roll'd,<br />
Bear two Peleiades emboss'd in gold;<br />
On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl;
</div>

<p>we are by that to understand one Peleias to. each section of the
handles. And he has called them <ins title="Greek: doias">δοιὰς</ins>, as being united to one another
and grown together as it were. For the word <ins title="Greek: doioi">δοιοὶ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: doiai">δοιαὶ</ins>,
signifies simply the number two, as in the passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Two tripods (<ins title="Greek: doious de tripodas">δοιοὺς δὲ τρίποδας</ins>), and ten golden talents;
</div>

<p>and again&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Two attendants (<ins title="Greek: doioi therapontes">δοιοὶ θεράπογτες</ins>):
</div>

<p>and it also at times intimates a natural connexion subsisting between
the two things spoken of, as well as that they are two in number; as in
these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There grew two (<ins title="Greek: doioi">δοιοὶ</ins>) olives, closest of the grove,<br />
With roots entwined and branches interwove,<br />
Alike their leaves, but not alike they smiled<br />
With sister fruits,&mdash;one fertile, one was wild:&mdash;
</div>

<p>and accordingly this calculation will give altogether four Peleiades
upon the handles.</p>

<p>82. "And, then, when he adds this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And curling vines, around each handle roll'd,<br />
Bear two Peleiades emboss'd in gold:<br />
On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl;
</div>

<p>we are to understand not two actual separate bases, nor indeed
ought we to read <ins title="Greek: hypopythmenes">ὑποπυθμένες</ins> as two words, like Dionysius the Thracian,
but we ought to read it as one word, <ins title="Greek: hypopythmenes">υποπυθμενες</ins>,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 786]</span>

in order to
understand it with reference to the Peleiades, that there were four
Peleiades on the handles, and two more <ins title="Greek: hypopythmenes">ὑποπυθμένες</ins>, which is equivalent
to <ins title="Greek: hypo tô pythmeni">ὑπὸ τῷ πυθμένι</ins>, that is to say, under the pedestal, as if the word
were <ins title="Greek: hypopythmenioi">ὑποπυθμένιοι</ins>. So that the goblet is supported by two Peleiades which
lie under the bottom, and in that way there are altogether six Pleiades
in all, since that is the number which are seen, though they are said
to be seven in number, as Aratus says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
They are indeed declared by mortal man<br />
To be in number seven; yet no more<br />
Than six have e'er been seen by mortal eyes.<br />
Not that a star can e'er have disappear'd<br />
Unnoticed from the pure expanse of heaven<br />
Since we have heard of its existence; but<br />
The number has been stated carelessly,<br />
And therefore they are usually call'd seven.
</div>

<p>Accordingly, what is seen in the stars the poet has very suitably
described among the ornaments made on the occasion. And many fancy that
the poet is here referring to Jupiter, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing,<br />
That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king,<br />
But shuns these rocks. In vain she cuts the skies,<br />
They fearful meet, and crush her as she flies.
</div>

<p>Meaning in reality, that one of the Pleiades was destroyed by the
sharpness of the rocks and their smooth edge, and that another is
substituted in her place by Jupiter for the sake of keeping the number
undiminished. Expressing by the enigmatical figures of speech common to
poets, that, though there are only six Pleiades seen, still their real
number is not actually diminished; but there are said to be seven in
number, and also the names of the seven are distinctly given.</p>

<p>83. But as for those people who contend that there is no
appropriateness in embossing the Pleiades on this cup, as they are
rather indicative of dry food, we must state that this kind of cup
is calculated to receive both solid and liquid food; for <ins title="Greek: kykeô">κυκεὼν</ins><a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> is made in it; and this is a kind of potion, having mixed in
it cheese and meal; and the poet tells us
that both these ingredients are stirred up (<ins title="Greek: kykômena">κυκωμένα</ins>) together
and so drunk:&mdash;</p>

<p>thinking that "heaved with ease by him" is said of Machaon, as he was
the person for whom the cup has been mixed, as he had been wounded; but
we shall show hereafter that Machaon is never represented in Homer as
wounded. But these men do not perceive, that when Homer says <ins title="Greek: allos">ἄλλος</ins>, he
is not speaking of Machaon and Nestor alone (for these two are drinking
of the cup), for in that case he would have said <ins title="Greek: heteros">ἕτερος</ins>. For <ins title="Greek: heteros">ἕτερος</ins> is

cup up from the table without an effort, but that Nestor raised it
easily, without any labour or distress. For the cup is described as

Nestor, being very fond of drinking, was easily able to lift, from his
constant practice.</p>

exertion. For it appeared unreasonable, that when Diomede and Ajax, and
even Achilles too were present, Nestor should be represented as more
vigorous than they, when he was so far advanced in years. But though

<ins title="Greek: pleion eon, Nestôr d' ho gerôn amogêti aeiren">πλεῖον ἐὸν, Νέστωρ δ᾽ ὁ γέρων ἀμογητὶ ἄειρεν</ins>,
</div>

<p>if we take <ins title="Greek: gerôn">γέρων</ins> out of the middle, we shall unite that to the
beginning of the preceding line, after <ins title="Greek: allos men">ἄλλος μὲν</ins>, and then we shall
connect the words as before&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

<p>Now then, when the words are arranged in this way, Nestor only appears
to be represented as the only one of the old men who could lift the cup
without an extraordinary effort.'</p>

<p>"These are the observations of that admirable solver of difficulties,
Sosibius. But Ptolemy Philadelphus the king jested upon him with some
wit, on account of this and other much talked-of solutions. For as
Sosibius received a royal stipend, Ptolemy, sending for his treasurers,
desired them, when Sosibius came to demand his stipend, to tell him
that he had received it already. And when, not long after, he did come
and ask for his money, they said they had given it to him already, and
said no more. But he, going to the king,
accused the treasurers. And Ptolemy sent for them, and ordered them to
come with their books, in which were the lists of those who received
those stipends. And when they had arrived, the king took the books into
his hands, and looking into them himself, also asserted that Sosibius
had received his money; making it out in this way:&mdash;These names were
set down,&mdash;Soter, Sosigenes, Bion, Apollon, Dion; and the king, looking
on these names, said&mdash;My excellent solver of difficulties, if you take
<ins title="Greek: Sô">Σω</ins> from <ins title="Greek: Sôtêr">Σωτὴρ</ins>,
and <ins title="Greek: si">σι</ins> from <ins title="Greek: Sôsigenês">Σωσιγένης</ins>,
and the first syllable <ins title="Greek: bi">βι</ins> from
<ins title="Greek: Biôn">Βίων</ins> and the last syllable from
<ins title="Greek: Apollônos">Ἀπόλλωνος</ins>, you will find, on your own
principles, that you have received your stipend. And you are caught in
this way, not owing to the actions of others, but by your own feathers,
as the incomparable Æschylus says, since you yourself are always
occupied about solutions of difficulties which are foreign to the
subject in hand."</p>

<p>86. There is the holmus also. This, too, is a drinking-cup, made in the
fashion of a horn. Menesthenes, in the fourth book of his Politics,
writes thus&mdash;"A twisted albatanes and a golden holmus. But the holmus
is a cup wrought after the fashion of a horn, about a cubit in height."</p>

<p>87. There is also the oxybaphum. Now common usage gives this name to
the cruet that holds the vinegar; but it is also the name of a cup; and
it is mentioned by Cratinus, in his Putina, in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
How can a man now make him leave off this<br />
Excessive drinking? I can tell a way;<br />
For I will break his jugs and measures all,<br />
And crush his casks as with a thunderbolt,<br />
And all his other vessels which serve to drink:<br />
Nor shall he have a single oxybaphum left,<br />
Fit to hold wine.
</div>

<p>But that the oxybaphum is a kind of small <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>, made of
earthenware, Antiphanes proves plainly enough, in his Mystis, in the
following words.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> There is a wine-bibbing old

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 790]</span>

woman praising a large cup, and disparaging the oxybaphum as small. So
when some one says to her&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Do you, then, drink;
</div>

<p>she answers&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace7">There I will obey you.</span><br />
And, by the gods, the figure of the cup<br />
Is quite inviting, worthy of the fame<br />
Of this high festival; for have we not&mdash;<br />
Have we not, and not long ago, I say,<br />
Drunk out of earthenware oxybapha?<br />
But may the gods, my son, give many blessings<br />
To him who made this cup&mdash;a noble cup,<br />
As to its beauty and its good capacity.
</div>

<p>And also in the Babylonians of Aristophanes we hear of the oxybaphum as
a drinking-cup, when Bacchus speaks of the demagogues at Athens, saying
that they demanded of him two oxybapha when he was going away to trial.
For we cannot think that they asked him for anything but cups. And the
oxybaphum, which is put before the people who play at the cottabus,
into which they pour their drops of wine, can be nothing else but a
flat cup. Eubulus also, in his Mylothris, mentions the oxybaphum as a
cup&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And besides, I measure out for drinking<br />
An oxybaphum all round; and then he swore<br />
The wine was nothing but pure vinegar,<br />
And that the vinegar was wine, at least<br />
Superior to the other.
</div>

<p>88. There is the oinisteria too. The young men, when they are going to
cut their hair, says Pamphilus, fill a large cup with wine, and bring
it to Hercules; and they call this cup an oinisteria. And when they
have poured a libation, they give it to the assembled people to drink.</p>

<p>There is the ollix also. Pamphilus, in his Attic Words, describes this
as a wooden cup.</p>

<p>89. There is also the panathenaicum. Posidonius the philosopher, in the
thirty-sixth book of his History, mentions some cups called by this
name, speaking thus&mdash;"There were also cups made of an onyx, and also of
several precious stones joined together, holding about two cotyl&aelig;. And
very large cups, called panathenaica, some holding two choes, and some
even larger."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 791]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>There is the proaron too. This was a wooden cup, into
which the Athenians used to pour mixed wine. "In hollow proara," says
Pamphilus.</p>

<p>90. Then there is the pelica. Callistratus, in his Commentary on the
Thracian Women of Cratinus, calls this a <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>. But Crates,
in the second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect, writes
thus:&mdash;"Choes, as we have already said, were called pelic&aelig;. But the
form of this vessel was at first like that of the panathenaica, when it
was called pelica; but afterwards it was made of the same shape as the
&oelig;nochoe, such as those are which are put on the table at festivals,
which they formerly used to call olp&aelig;, using them for infusing the
wine, as Ion the Chian, in his Sons of Eurytus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
You make a noise, intemperately drawing<br />
Superfluous wine from the large casks with olp&aelig;.
</div>

<p>But now a vessel of that sort, which has been consecrated in some
fashion or other, is placed on the table at festivals alone. And that
which comes into every-day use has been altered in form, being now
generally made like a ladle, and we call it choeus." But Clitarchus
says that the Corinthians, and Byzantians, and Cyprians call an
oil-cruet, which is usually called lecythus, olpa; and the Thessalians
call it prochous. But Seleucus says that the B&oelig;otians call a <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>
pelichna; but Euphronius, in his Commentaries, says that they
give this name to a choeus.</p>

<p>91. There is the pella. This is a vessel resembling the scyphus, having
a wider bottom, into which men used to milk the cattle. Homer says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode,<br />
The pails <ins title="Greek: pellai">πέλλαι</ins> high foaming with a milky flood,<br />
The buzzing flies, a persevering train,<br />
Incessant swarm, and chased, return again.
</div>

<p>But Hipponax calls this pellis; saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Drinking from pellides; for there was not<br />
A culix there,&mdash;the slave had fallen down,<br />
And broken it to pieces;
</div>

<p>showing, I imagine, very plainly that the pellis was not a
drinking-cup, but that on this occasion they used it as one, from want
of a regular culix. And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And they at different times from out the pella<br />
Did drink; and then again Arete pledged them.
</div>

<p>But Phoenix the Colophonian, in his Iambics, interprets this word as
identical with the phiala; saying,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 792]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
For Thales,&mdash;honestest of all the citizens,<br />
And, as they say, by far the best of men<br />
Who at that time were living upon earth,&mdash;<br />
Took up a golden pellis.
</div>

<p>And in another part he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And with one hand he pours from out the pellis,<br />
Weak as he was in all his limbs and fingers,<br />
A sharp libation of sour vinegar,<br />
Trembling, like age, by Boreas much shaken.
</div>

<p>But Clitarchus, in his Dialects, says that the Thessalians and &AElig;olians
call the milk-pail pelleter; but that it is a drinking-cup which they
call pella. But Philetas, in his Miscellanies, says that the B&oelig;otians
give the name of pelleter to a culix.</p>

<p>92. There is also the pentaploa. Philochorus mentions this, in the
second book of his treatise on Attic Affairs. But Aristodemus, in the
third book of his Commentary on Pindar, says that on the third day of
the Scira, games are celebrated at Athens, in which the young men run
races; and that they run, holding in their hands a branch of the vine
loaded with fruit, which is called oschus. And they run from the temple
of Bacchus to the temple of Minerva Sciras; and he who has gained
the victory takes a cup of the species called pentaplous, and feasts
with the rest of the runners. But the cup is called pentaplous, as
containing five (<ins title="Greek: pente">πέντε</ins>) ingredients; inasmuch as it has in it
wine, and honey, and cheese, and meal, and a little oil.</p>

<p>There is the petachnum. This is a cup of a flat shape, which is
mentioned by Alexis, in his Dropidas; and the passage has been already
cited. And Aristophanes also mentions it in his Dramas, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And every one indoors drinks out of petachna.
</div>

<p>93. There is the plemochoe, too. This is an earthenware vessel, shaped
like a top, not very steady; and some people call it the cotyliscus, as
Pamphilus tells us. But they use it at Eleusis on the last day of the
Mysteries, which day they call Plemochoai, from the cups. And on this
day they fill two plemocho&aelig;, and place one looking towards the east,
and the other looking towards the west, saying over them a mystic form
of words; and the author of the Pirithous names them (whoever he was,
whether Critias the tyrant, or Euripides), saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
That with well-omen'd words we now may pour<br />
These plemocho&aelig; into the gulf below.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 793]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>There is a vessel, too, called the pristis; and that this is a species
of cup has been already stated in the discussion on the batiacium.</p>

<p>94. There is the prochytes, too. This is a kind of drinking-cup, as
Simaristus says, in the fourth book of his Synonymes. But Ion the
Chian, in his Elegies, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But let the cupbearing maidens fill for us<br />
A crater with their silver prochyt&aelig;;
</div>

<p>and Philetas, in his Miscellanies, says it is a wooden vessel, from
which the countrymen drink: and Alexander also mentions it in his
Tigon. And Xenophon, in the eighth book of his Cyrop&aelig;dia, calls some
kinds of culices, prochoides, writing thus (and it is of the Persians
that he is speaking):&mdash;"But it was a custom among them not to bring
prochoides into their banquets, evidently because they think that not
drinking too much is good both for the body and the mind. And even
now the custom prevails that they do not bring them; but they drink
such a quantity of wine that, instead of carrying in their cups, they
themselves are carried out, when they can no longer go out themselves
in an upright attitude."</p>

<p>There is also the Prusias; and it has been already said that this is an
upright kind of cup, and that it derived its name from Prusias king of
Bithynia, who was a man very notorious for his luxury and effeminacy;
as is mentioned by Nicander the Chalcedonian, in the fourth book of his
History of the Events of the Life of Prusias.</p>

<p>95. There are also rheonta; for this was a name given to some cups: and
Astydamas mentions them in his Mercury, speaking thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
First of all were two silver craters large,<br />
And fifty phial&aelig;, and ten cymbia,<br />
And twelve rheonta, two of which were gold,<br />
The others silver;&mdash;of the gold ones, one<br />
Was like a griffin, one like Pegasus.
</div>

<p>There is also the rhysis. This is called a golden phiala by Theodorus;
and Cratinus, in his Laws, says&mdash;"Pouring a libation from a rhysis."</p>

<p>96. There is also the Rhodias. Diphilus, in his Stormer of Walls (but
Callimachus calls the play The Eunuch), speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And they intend to drink more plenteously<br />

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 794]</span>

Than rhodiaca or rhyta can supply.
</div>

<p>Dioxippus, too, mentions this cup, in his Miser; and so does Aristotle,
in his treatise on Drunkenness; and so also does Lynceus the Samian, in
his Letters.</p>

<p>97. There is also the rhytum&mdash;<ins title="Greek: rhyton">ῥυτόν</ins>. The <ins title="Greek: y">υ</ins> is short,
and the word has an acute accent on the last syllable. Demosthenes, in
his speech against Midias, speaks of "rhyta, and cymbia, and phial&aelig;."
But Diphilus, in his Eunuch, or The Soldier, (and this play is a new
edition of his Stormer of Walls,) says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And they intend to drink more plenteously<br />
Than rhodiaca or rhyta can supply.
</div>

<p>And Epinicus, in his Supposititious Damsels, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> And of the large-sized rhyta three are here;</span><br />
To-day one will be forced to drink more steadily,<br />
By the clepsydra.<br />
<span class="linespace6_5"><i>B.</i> This, I think, will act</span><br />
Both ways.<br />
<span class="linespace4"><i>A.</i> Why, 'tis an elephant!</span><br />
<span class="linespace13"><i>B.</i> Yes, he</span><br />
Is bringing round his elephants.<br />
<span class="linespace12_25"><i>A.</i> A rhytus,</span><br />
Holding two choes, such as e'en an elephant<br />
Could hardly drink; but I have drunk it often.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Yes, for you're very like an elephant.</span><br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> There is besides another kind of cup,</span><br />
Its name a trireme; this, too, holds one choeus.
</div>

<p>And, speaking of the rhytum, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> Bellerophon, on Pegasus's back,</span><br />
Fought and subdued the fire-breathing Chim&aelig;ra.<br />
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>B.</i> Well, take this cup.</span>
</div>

<p>But formerly a drinking-horn was also called a rhytum; and it appears
that this kind of vessel was first made by Ptolemy Philadelphus the
king, to be carried by the statues of Arsinoe: for in her right hand
she bears a vessel of this kind, full of all the fruits of the season;
by which the makers of it designed to show that this horn is richer
than the horn of Amalthea. And it is mentioned by Theocles, in his
Ithyphallics, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
For all the journeymen to-day<br />
<span class="linespace1">Have sacrificed Soteria;</span><br />
And in their company I've drunk this cup,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And now I go to my dear king.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 795]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>But Dionysius of Sinope, in his Female Saviour, giving a list of some
cups, has also mentioned the rhytus, as I have said
before; but Hedylus, in his Epigrams, mentioning the rhytum made by
Ctesibius the engineer or machinist, speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come hither, all ye drinkers of sheer wine,&mdash;<br />
<span class="linespace1">Come, and within this shrine behold this rhytus,</span><br />
The cup of fair Arsinoe Zephyritis,<br />
<span class="linespace1">The true Egyptian Besa, which pours forth</span><br />
Shrill sounds, what time its stream is open'd wide,&mdash;<br />
<span class="linespace1">No sound of war; but from its golden mouth</span><br />
It gives a signal for delight and feasting,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Such as the Nile, the king of flowing rivers,</span><br />
Pours as its melody from its holy shrines,<br />
<span class="linespace1">Dear to the priests of sacred mysteries.</span><br />
But honour this invention of Ctesibius,<br />
<span class="linespace1">And come, O youths, to fair Arsinoe's temple.</span>
</div>

<p>But Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drunkenness, says that the cup
called the rhytum is given to heroes alone. Dorotheus the Sidonian,
says that the rhyta resemble horns, but are perforated at both ends,
and men drink of them at the bottom as they send forth a gentle stream;
and that it derives its name from the liquor flowing from them (<ins title="Greek: apo
tês rhyseôs">ἀπὸ τῆς ῥύσεως</ins>).</p>

<p>98. There is the sannacra too. Crates, in the fifth book of his
treatise on the Attic Dialect, says that it is a drinking-cup which
bears this name, but it is a Persian cup. But Philemon, in his Widow,
mentioning the batiacia, and jesting on the ridiculousness of the name,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The sannacra, and hippotragelaphi,<br />
And batiacia, and sannacia.
</div>

<p>There is also the Seleuci; and we have already stated that this cup
derives its name from king Seleucus; Apollodorus the Athenian having
made the same statement. But Polemo, in the first chapter of his
treatise addressed to Ad&aelig;us, says these goblets are very like one
another, the Seleucis, the Rhodias, and the Antigonis.</p>

<p>Then, there is the scallium. This is a small cup (<ins title="Greek: kylikion">κυλίκον</ins>), with
which the &AElig;olians pour libations, as Philetas tells us, in his
Miscellanies.</p>

<p>99. There is also the scyphus. Now some people form the genitive of
this word <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύθος</ins> with a <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins> invariably; but they are mistaken: for
sometimes <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύθος</ins> is masculine, like <ins title="Greek: lychnos">λύχνος</ins>, and then we form its
genitive case without <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins> but when <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύθος</ins> is neuter, then we must decline
with the <ins title="Greek: s">ς</ins>, <ins title="Greek: skyphos skyphous">σκύθος σκύθους</ins>,
like <ins title="Greek: teichos teichous">τεῖχος τείχους</ins>. But the Attic writers
use the nominative case in both the masculine and neuter
genders. And Hesiod, in the second book of his Melampodia, writes the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 796]</span>

word with a <ins title="Greek: p">π</ins>, <ins title="Greek: skypphos">σκύπθοσ</ins>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
To him came Mares, a swift messenger,<br />
Straight from his house; he fill'd a silver cup (<ins title="Greek: skypphos">σκύθος</ins>),<br />
And brought it in his hand, and gave it to the king.
</div>

<p>And in another place he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And then the prophet in his right hand took<br />
The chain that held the bull; and on his back<br />
Iphiclus laid his hand: and following then,<br />
Holding a cup (<ins title="Greek: skypphos">σκύπθος</ins>) in one hand, in the other<br />
Raising a staff, brave Phylacus advanced,<br />
And, standing amid the servants, thus he spoke.
</div>

<p>And in the same manner Anaximander in his Heroology speaks, where
he says, "But Amphitryon, when he had divided the booty among his
allies, and having the cup (<ins title="Greek: skypphos">σκύπθος</ins>) which he had selected
for himself, . . ." And in another place he says&mdash;"But Neptune gives his
<ins title="Greek: skypphos">σκύπθος</ins> to Teleboas his own son, and Teleboas to Pteselaus;
and he when he received it sailed away." And in the same manner
Anacreon has said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But I, in my right hand holding<br />
A <ins title="Greek: skypphos">σκύπθος</ins> full of wine,<br />
Drank to the health of the white-crested Erxion.
</div>

<p>(And in this last line he uses the verb <ins title="Greek: exepinon">ἐξέπινον</ins> instead of <ins title="Greek: proepinon">προέεπινον</ins>
For properly speaking <ins title="Greek: propinô">προπίνω</ins> means to give to some one else to drink
before yourself. And so Ulysses, in Homer,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Gave to Arete first the well-fill'd cup.
</div>

<p>And in the Iliad he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And first he fill'd a mighty cup of wine,<br />
Then pledg'd the hero, Peleus' son divine;
</div>

<p>for they used, when they had filled their cups, to pledge one another
with a friendly address.) Panyasis, in the third book of his Heraclea,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This wine he pour'd into an ample bowl,<br />
Radiant with gold, and then with frequent draughts<br />
He drain'd the flowing cup.
</div>

<p>Euripides, in his Eurystheus, uses the word in the masculine gender&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And a long cup (<ins title="Greek: skyphos te makros">σκύφος τε μακρός</ins>).
</div>

<p>And so does Ach&aelig;us, in his Omphale&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The goblet of the god invites me (<ins title="Greek: ho de skyphos me tou theou kalei">ὁ δὲ σκύθος με τοῦ θεοῦ ῾Ἀλεἶ</ins>).
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 797]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>And Simonides too, speaking of a cup with handles, says, <ins title="Greek: ouatoenta skyphon">οὐατόεντα
σκύφον</ins>. But Ion, in his Omphale, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There is no wine in the cup (<ins title="Greek: oinos ouk eni en tô skyphei">οἶνος οὐκ ἔνι ἐν τῷ σκύφεἰ</ins>),
</div>

<p>forming <ins title="Greek: skyphei">σκύφει</ins> regularly from <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins>, as a neuter noun. And in the same
way Epicharmus, in his Cyclops, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Come, pour the wine into the cup (<ins title="Greek: es to skyphos">ἐς τὸ σκύφος</ins>).
</div>

<p>And Alexis, in his Leucadia, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And with his aged lips he drank<br />
A mighty cup <ins title="Greek: mega skyphos">μέγα σκύφος</ins> of fragrant wine.
</div>

<p>And Epigenes, in his Bacchea, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I rejoiced when I received <ins title="Greek: to skyphos">τὸ σκύφος</ins>.
</div>

<p>And Ph&aelig;dimus, in the first book of his Heraclea, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A mighty cup (<ins title="Greek: eury skyphos">εὐρὺ σκύφος</ins>) of well-grain'd timber framed,<br />
And fill'd with honied wine.
</div>

<p>And also in Homer, Aristophanes the Byzantian writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But having filled a cup <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins>, he gave it him,<br />
Having himself drunk from the same.
</div>

<p>But Aristarchus in this line writes <ins title="Greek: skyphon">σκύφον</ins>, not <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins>.</p>

<p>But Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his treatise on the Nestoris, says that
none of those who lived in the city, and none of the men of moderate
property, used the scyphus (<ins title="Greek: tô skyphei">τῷ σκύφει</ins>) and the cissybium; but
only the swineherds, and shepherds, and men in the fields, as Eum&aelig;us,
for instance,</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Gave him the cup (<ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins>) from which he drank himself,<br />
Well fill'd with wine.
</div>

<p>And Alcman says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And often on the highest mountain tops,<br />
When some most tuneful festival of song<br />
Is held in honour of the Gods, you hold<br />
A golden vessel,—a fine, ample cup <ins title="Greek: skyphon">σκύφον̓</ins>,<br />
Such as the shepherds, pasturing their flocks<br />
On the high hills, delight in, . . . . . . . .<br />
 . . . . . . . . . . . . have made cheese<br />

<p>And &AElig;schylus, in his Perrh&aelig;bians, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Where are my many gifts and warlike spoils,&mdash;<br />
Where are my gold and silver cups (<ins title="Greek: skyphômata">σκυφώματα</ins>)̣?
</div>

<p>And Stesichorus calls the cup on the board of Pholus the Centaur
<ins title="Greek: skypheion depas">σκύφειον δέπας</ins>, using <ins title="Greek: skypheion">σκύφειον</ins>
as synonymous to <ins title="Greek: skyphoeides">σκυφοειδές</ins>. And he
says, when speaking of Hercules&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

And gave him; and at one good draught he drank it.
</div>

<p>And Archippus, in his Amphitryon, has used the word in the neuter
gender.</p>

<p>100. But as for the word <ins title="Greek: lagynon">λάγυνον</ins>, they say that that is the name of
a measure among the Greeks, as also are the words <ins title="Greek: choos">χοὸς</ins> and <ins title="Greek: kotylê">κοτύλη</ins>.
And they say that the <ins title="Greek: lagynon">λάγυνον</ins> contains twelve Attic <ins title="Greek: kotylai">κότυλαι</ins>. And at
Patræ they say that there is a regular measure called <ins title="Greek: hê lagynos">ἡ λάγυνος</ins>. But
Nicostratus, in his Hecate, has used the word in the masculine gender,
<ins title="Greek: ho lagynos">ὁ λάγυνος</ins>, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> And yet among the flagons into which</span><br />

<div class="blockindent">
Bring us the full flagon (<ins title="Greek: ton meston lagynon">τὸν μεστὸν λάγυνον</ins>).

<p>And, in the play entitled The Couch, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And this most odious flagon's (<ins title="Greek: lagynos houtos">λάγυνος οὗτος</ins>) full of vinegar.
</div>

<p>Diphilus, in his People Saved, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I have an empty flagon, my good woman,<br />
And a full wallet.
</div>

<p>And Lynceus the Samian, in his letter to Diagoras, says,&mdash;"At the time
that you sojourned in Samos, O Diagoras, I know that you often came to
banquets at my house, at which a flagon was placed by each man, and
filled with wine, so as to allow every one to drink at his pleasure."
And Aristotle, in his Constitution of the Thessalians, says that the
word is used by the Thessalians in the feminine gender, as ἡ λάγυνος.
And Rhianus the epic poet, in his Epigrams, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
This flagon (<ins title="Greek: hêde lagynos">ἥδε λάγυνος</ins>), O Archinus, seems to hold<br />

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<p>And the line in the Geryonis of Stesichorus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A measure of three flagons (<ins title="Greek: emmetron hôs trilagynon">ἔμμετρον ὡς τριλάγυνον̓</ins>),
</div>

<p>leaves it quite uncertain under what gender the word is to be classed
as far as respects that line. But Eratosthenes says that the words
<ins title="Greek: petasos">πέτασος</ins> and <ins title="Greek: stamnos">στάμνος</ins> are also used as feminine nouns
by some authors.</p>

<p>101. But the name <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins> is derived from <ins title="Greek: skaphis">σκαφὶς</ins>, a
little boat. And this likewise is a round vessel made of wood, intended
to receive milk, or whey; as it is said in Homer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Capacious chargers all around were laid,<br />
Full pails (<ins title="Greek: skaphides">σκαφίδες</ins>), and vessels of the milking trade.
</div>

<p>Unless, indeed, <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins> is quasi <ins title="Greek: skythos">σκύθος</ins>, because
the Scythians were in the habit of drinking more than was decent.
But Hieronymus the Rhodian, in his treatise on Drunkenness, says to
get drunk is called <ins title="Greek: skythizô">σκυθίζω</ins>; for that <ins title="Greek: th">θ</ins> is a
cognate letter to <ins title="Greek: ph">φ</ins>. But at subsequent times scyphi were
made of earthenware and of silver, in imitation of the wooden ones.
And the first makers of cups of this kind were the B&oelig;otians, who
obtained a high reputation for their manufacture; because Hercules
originally used these cups in his expeditions. On which account they
are called Heracleotici by some people. And they are different from
other cups; for they have on their handles what is called the chain of
Hercules. And Bacchylides mentions the B&oelig;otian scyphi in these words,
(addressing his discourse to Castor and Pollux, and invoking their
attendance at a banquet)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Here there are no mighty joints<br />
Of oxen slain,&mdash;no golden plate,<br />
No purple rich embroidery;<br />
But there is a cheerful mind,<br />
And a sweetly-sounding Muse,<br />
And plenty of delicious wine,<br />
In cups of Theban workmanship (<ins title="Greek: Boiôtioisin en skyphoisin">Βοιωτίοισιν ἐν σκύφοισιν̓</ins>).
</div>

<p>And next to the B&oelig;otian scyphi, those which had the highest reputation
were the Rhodian ones, of the workmanship of Damocrates. And the next
to them were the Syracusan cups. But the <ins title="Greek: skyphos">σκύφος</ins> is called
by the Epirotes <ins title="Greek: lyrtos">λυρτὸς</ins>, as Seleucus reports; and by the
Methymn&aelig;ans it is called <ins title="Greek: skythos">σκύθος</ins>, as Parmeno says, in his book
on Dialects. And Dercyllidas the Laced&aelig;monian was nicknamed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 800]</span>

Σκύθος, as Ephorus relates in his eighteenth book, where he speaks as
follows:&mdash;"The Laced&aelig;monians sent Dercyllidas into Asia in the place of
Thymbron, having heard that the barbarians were in the habit of doing
everything by deceit and trick; on which account they sent Dercyllidas,
thinking that he was the least likely of all men to be taken in;
for he was not at all of a Laced&aelig;monian and simple disposition, but
exceedingly cunning and fierce; on which account the Laced&aelig;monians
themselves used to call him Σκύθον."</p>

<p>102. There is the tabaitas also. Amyntas, in the first book of his
treatise on the Stations of Asia, speaking of what is called aerial
honey, writes as follows:&mdash;"They gather it with the leaves, and store
it up, making it up in the same manner as the Syrian cakes of fruit,
but some make it into balls; and when they are about to use it for
food, they break pieces off these cakes into wooden cups, which they
call tabait&aelig;, and soak them, and then strain them off and drink the
liquor; and the drink is very like diluted honey, but this is much the
sweeter of the two."</p>

<p>There is also the tragelaphus. And this is the name given to some cups,
as Alexis mentions, in his Coniates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Cymbia, phial&aelig;, tragelaphi, culices.
</div>

<p>And Eubulus, in his Man Glued on, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
But there are five phial&aelig;, and two tragelaphi.
</div>

<p>And Menander, in his Fisherman, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Tragelaphi, labronii.
</div>

<p>And Antiphanes, in his Chrysis, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And for this rich and sordid bridegroom now,<br />
Who owns so many talents, slaves, and stewards,<br />
And pairs of horses, camels, coverlets,&mdash;<br />
Such loads of silver plate, such phial&aelig;,<br />
Triremes, tragelaphi, carchesia,<br />
Milkpails of solid gold, vessels of all sorts;<br />
For all the gluttons and the epicures<br />
Call casks brimful of wine mere simple milkpails.
</div>

<p>There is also the trireme. And that trireme is the name of a species of
drinking-cup Epicurus has shown, in his Supposititious Damsels; and the
passage which is a proof of this has been already quoted.</p>

<p>There is also the hystiacum, which is some sort of drinking-cup.
Rhinthon, in his Hercules, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 801]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
You swallow'd, in one small hystiacum,<br />
A cheesecake of pure meal, and groats, and flour.
</div>

<p>103. There is the phiale too. Homer, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He placed a phiale upon the board,<br />
By both hands to be raised (<ins title="Greek: amphitheton">ἀμφίθετον</ins>), untouch'd by fire;
</div>

<p>and again, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A golden phiale, and doubled fat;
</div>

<p>is not speaking of a drinking-cup, but of a brazen vessel of a flat
shape like a caldron, having perhaps two handles, one on each side. But
Parthenius the pupil of Dionysius understands by <ins title="Greek: amphitheton">ἀμφίθετον</ins> a
phiale without any bottom. But Apollodorus the Athenian, in his short
essay on the Crater, says that it means a cup which cannot be firmly
placed and steadied on its bottom, but only on its mouth. But some
say, that just as the word <ins title="Greek: amphiphoreus">ἀμφιφορεὺς</ins> is used for a cup
which can be lifted by its handles on both sides, the same is meant
by the expression <ins title="Greek: amphithetos phialê">ἀμφίθετος φιάλη</ins>. But Aristarchus says
that it means a cup which can be placed on either end, on its mouth or
on its bottom. But Dionysius the Thracian says that the word <ins title="Greek: amphithetos">ἀμφίθετος
means round, running round (<ins title="Greek: amphitheôn">ἀμφιθέων</ins>) in a
circular form. And Asclepiades the Myrlean says,&mdash;"The word <ins title="Greek: phialê">φιάλη</ins>,
by a change of letters, becomes <ins title="Greek: pialê">πιάλη</ins>, a cup which
contains enough to drink (<ins title="Greek: piein halis">πιεῖν ἅλις</ins>); for it is larger than
the <ins title="Greek: potêrion">ποτήριον</ins>. But when Homer calls it also <ins title="Greek: apyrôtos">ἀπύρωτος</ins></ins>,
he means either that it was wrought without fire, or never put on the
fire. On which account he calls a kettle which may be
put on the fire <ins title="Greek: empyribêtês">ἐμπυριβήτης</ins>, and one which is not so used <ins title="Greek: apyros">ἄπυρος</ins>. And
when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
An ample charger, of unsullied frame,<br />
With flowers high wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame,
</div>

<p>he perhaps means one intended to receive cold water. So that the
phiale would in that case resemble a flat brazen vessel, holding cold
water. But when he calls it <ins title="Greek: amphithetos">ἀμφίθετος</ins>, can we understand that it has
two bases, one on each side; or is<ins title="Greek: amphi"> ἀμφὶ</ins> here to be taken as equivalent
to <ins title="Greek: peri">περὶ</ins>, and then again is <ins title="Greek: peri">περὶ</ins> to be taken
as equivalent to <ins title="Greek: peritton">περιττὸν</ins>,
so that in fact all that is meant by the epithet is beautifully made;
since <ins title="Greek: theinai">θεῖναι</ins> was often used by the ancients for 'to make?' It may also
mean, ' being capable of being placed either on its bottom or upon its
mouth;' and such a placing of cups is an Ionian [p. 802] and an ancient
fashion. And even now the Massilians often adopt it, and set their
goblets down on their mouths."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 802]</span></p>

<p>104. But as Cratinus has said, in his Female Runaways&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Receive from me these round-bottom'd phial&aelig;,
</div>

<p>Eratosthenes, in the eleventh book of his treatise on Comedy, says
that Lycophron did not understand the meaning of the word (<ins title="Greek: balaneiomphalos">βαλανειόμφαλος</ins>),
for that the word <ins title="Greek: omphalos">ὀμφαλὸς</ins>, as applied to
a phiale, and the word <ins title="Greek: tholos">θόλος</ins>, as applied to a bath, were
nearly similar in meaning; and that, in the word, allusion is neatly
enough made to the umbilical form. But Apion and Diodorus say, "There
are some kinds of phial&aelig; of which the boss is similar to a strainer."
But Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his Essays on Cratinus, says&mdash;
"<ins title="Greek: balaneiomphaloi">βαλανειόμφαλοι</ins> are the phial&aelig; called, because their bosses and the
vaulted roofs of the baths are much alike." And Didymus, saying the
same thing, cites the words of Lycophron, which run thus:&mdash;"From the
bosses in the women's baths, out of which they ladle the water in
small cups." But Timarchus, in the fourth book of his Essay on the
Mercury of Eratosthenes, says,&mdash;"Any one may suppose that this word
contains a secret allusion in it, because most of the baths at Athens,
being circular in their shape, and in all their furniture, have slight
projections in the middle, on which a brazen boss is placed. Ion, in
his Omphale, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Go quick, O damsels; hither bring the cups,<br />
And the mesomphali;&mdash;
</div>

<p>and by <ins title="Greek: mesomphaloi">μεσόμφαλοι</ins> here, he means the same things as those which
Cratinus calls <ins title="Greek: balaneiomphaloi">βαλανειόμφαλοι</ins>, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Receive from me these round-bottom'd phial&aelig;.
</div>

<p>And Theopompus, in his Alth&aelig;a, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
She took a golden round-bottom'd (<ins title="Greek: mesomphalon">μεσόμφαλον</ins>) phiale,<br />
Brimful of wine; to which Telestes gave<br />
The name of acatos;
</div>

<p>as Telestes had called the phiale an acatos, or boat. But Pherecrates,
or whoever the poet was who composed the Pers&aelig;, which are attributed to
him, says, in that play&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Garlands to all, and well-boss'd chrysides (<ins title="Greek: omphalôtai chrysides">ὀμφαλωταὶ χρυσίδες</ins>).<br />
</div>

<p>105. But the Athenians call silver phial&aelig; <ins title="Greek: argypides">ἀργυρίδες</ins>, and
golden ones they call <ins title="Greek: chrysides">χρυσίδες</ins>. And Pherecrates mentions the
silver phiale in the following words in his Pers&aelig;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 803]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
Here, you sir; where are you now carrying<br />
That silver phiale (<ins title="Greek: tên argyrida têndi">τὴν ἀργυρίδα τηνδί</ins>)?
</div>

<p>And Cratinus mentions the golden one in his Laws&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Making libations with a golden phiale (<ins title="Greek: chrysidi">χρυσίδἰ</ins>),<br />
He gave the serpents drink.
</div>

<p>And Hermippus, in his Cercopes, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He first completely drain'd an ample cup,<br />
Golden (<ins title="Greek: chrysida">χρυσίδα</ins>) and round, then carried it away.
</div>

<p>There was also a kind of cup called the <ins title="Greek: balanôtê">βαλανωτὴ</ins> phiale, under
the bottom of which were placed golden feet. And Teneus says, that
among the offerings at Delos there was a brazen palm-tree, the offering
of the Naxians, and some golden phial&aelig;, to which he gives the epithet
<ins title="Greek: karyôtai">καρυωταί</ins>. But Anaxandrides calls cups of this fashion the
phial&aelig; of Mars. But the &AElig;olians call the phiale an aracis.</p>

<p>106. There is also the phthoïs; these are wide-shaped phial&aelig; with
bosses. Eupolis says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
He pledged the guests in phthoïdes,
</div>

<p>writing the dative plural <ins title="Greek: phthoisi">φθοῖσι</ins>; but it ought to have an acute on the
last syllable; like <ins title="Greek: Karsi">καρσὶ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: paisi">παισὶ</ins>, <ins title="Greek: phtheirsi">φθειρσί</ins>.</p>

<p>There is the philotesia also. This is a kind of <ins title="Greek: kylix">κύλιξ</ins>, in
which they pledged one another out of friendship, as Pamphilus says.
And Demosthenes says, "And he pledged him in the philotesia." And
Alexis says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
We, in our private and public capacity,<br />
Do pledge you now in this philotesian culix.
</div>

<p>But, besides being the name of a cup, a company feasting together was
also called <ins title="Greek: philotêsion">φιλοτήσιον</ins>. Aristophanes says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now does the shadow of the descending sun<br />
Mark seven feet: 'tis time for supper now,<br />
And the philotesian company invites me.
</div>

<p>But it was from the system of pledging one another at these banquets
that the cup got the name of philotesia&mdash;as in the Lysistrata&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
O thou Persuasion, mistress of my soul!<br />
And you, O philotesian cup of wine.
</div>

<p>There are also chonni. Among the Gortynians this is the name given to a
species of cup resembling the thericleum, made of brass, which Hermonax
says is given by lovers to the objects of their affection.</p>

<p>There are also Chalcidic goblets, having their name and reputation
perhaps from Chalcis in Thrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 804]</span></p>

<p>107. There are also <ins title="Greek: chytrides">χυτρίδες</ins>; Alexis, in his Supposititious
Child, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
I, seeking to do honour to the king,<br />
To Ptolemy and to his sister, took<br />
Four <ins title="Greek: chytridia">χυτρίδια</ins> of strong, untemper'd wine,<br />
And drank them at a draught, with as much pleasure<br />
As any one ever swallow'd half-and-half:<br />
And, for the sake of this agreement, why<br />
Should I not now feast in this splendid light?
</div>

<p>But Herodotus, in the fifth book of his History, says "that the Argives
and &AElig;ginetans made a law that no one should ever use any Attic vessel
of any kind in their sacrifices, not even if made of earthenware;
but that for the future every one should drink out of the <ins title="Greek: chytrides">χυτρίδες</ins>
of the country." And Meleager the Cynic, in his Symposium,
writes as follows&mdash;"And in the meantime he proposed a deep pledge to
his health, twelve deep <ins title="Greek: chytridia">χυτρίδια</ins> full of wine."</p>

<p>108. There is also the <ins title="Greek: psygeus">ψυγεὺς</ins> or <ins title="Greek: psyktêr">ψυκτήρ</ins>. Plato, in
his Symposium, says,&mdash;"But, O boy, bring, said he, that psycter hither
(for he had seen one which held more than eight cotyl&aelig;). Accordingly,
when he had filled it, first of all he drank it himself, and then
he ordered it to be filled again for Socrates . . . . . as Archebulus was
attempting to be prolix, the boy, pouring the wine out at a very
seasonable time, overturned the psycter." And Alexis, in his Colonist,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
A psygeus, holding three full cotyl&aelig;.
</div>

<p>And Dioxippus, in his Miser, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And from Olympicus he then received<br />
Six thericlean cups, and then two psycters.
</div>

<p>And Menander, in his play entitled The Brazier's Shop, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And, as the present fashion is, they shouted<br />
For more untemper'd wine; and some one took<br />
A mighty psycter, giving them to drink,<br />
And so destroy'd them wretchedly.
</div>

<p>And Epigenes, in his Heroine, giving a list of many cups, among them
mentions the psygeus thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Now take the boys, and make them hither bring<br />
The thericlean and the Rhodian cups;<br />
But bring yourself the psycter and the cyathus,<br />
Some cymbia too.

<p>But Alexis, in his Hippiscus, uses the diminutive form, and calls it a

<div class="blockindent">
I went to see my friend while at his inn,<br />

<p>And in the Carna he declares plainly that, when pouring out wine, they
used the psycter for a cyathus. For after he had said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And putting on the board a tripod and cask,<br />
And psycter too, he gets drunk on the wine;
</div>

<p>in the passage following, he represents his man as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
So will the drink be fiercer: therefore now,<br />
If any one should say it is not fit<br />
T' indulge in wine at present, just leave out<br />
This cask, and this one single drinking-cup,<br />
And carry all the rest away at once.
</div>

<p>But Dionysius the pupil of Tryphon, in his treatise on Names,
says&mdash;"The ancients used to call the psygeus dinus." But Nicander of
Thyatira says, that woods and shady places dedicated to the gods are
also called <ins title="Greek: psyktêres">ψυκτῆρες</ins>, as being places where one may cool
oneself (<ins title="Greek: anapsyxai">ἀναψύξαι</ins>). &AElig;schylus, in his Young Men, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 806]</span></p>

<div class="blockindent">
And gentle airs, in the cool, shady places (<ins title="Greek: psyktêriois">ψυκτηρίοις</ins>);
</div>

<p>and Euripides, in his Phaethon, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
The trees, affording a cool shade (<ins title="Greek: psyktêria">ψυκτήρια</ins>),<br />
Shall now embrace him in their loving arms;
</div>

<p>and the author of the poem called &AElig;gimius, whether it really was
Hesiod, or only Cecrops of Miletus, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
There shall my cool shade (<ins title="Greek: psyktêrion">ψυκτήριον</ins>) be, O king of men.
</div>

<p>110. There is also the oidos. This was the name of a drinking-cup, as
we are told by Tryphon, in his Onomasticon; a cup given to him who sang
the scolia&mdash;as Antiphanes shows in his Doubles&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespaceneg1_2"><i>A.</i> What will there be, then, for the gods?</span><br />

</div>

<p>There are also the ooscyphia. Now respecting the shape of these cups,
Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his Essay on the Nestoris, says that it
has two bottoms, one of them wrought on to the bowl of the cup, and of
the same piece with it; but the other attached to it, beginning with a
sharp point, and ending in a broad bottom, on which the cup stands.</p>

<p>There is also the <ins title="Greek: ôon">ὠὸν</ins>, or egg-cup. Dinon, in the third book of
his Affairs of Persia, speaks as follows:&mdash;There is also a bread called
potibazis, made of barley and roasted wheat; and a crown of cypress
leaves; and wine tempered in a golden oon, from which the king himself
drinks."</p>

<p>111. Plutarch having said this, and being applauded by every one,
asked for a phiala, from which he made a libation to the Muses, and
to Mnemosyne their mother, and drank the health of every one present,
saying,&mdash;As if any one, taking a cup in his hand, being a rich man,
were to make a present of it, foaming over with the juice of the
vine;"&mdash;and drinking not only to the young bridegroom, but also to all
his friends; and he gave the cup to the boy, desiring him to carry it
round to every one, saying that this was the proper meaning of the
phrase <ins title="Greek: kyklô pinein">κύκλῳ πίνειν</ins>, reciting the verses of Menander in his
Perinthian Woman&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
And the old woman did not leave untouch'd<br />
One single cup, but drank of all that came.
</div>

<p>And again, in his Fanatical Woman, he says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 807]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">DRINKING-CUPS.</div>

<div class="blockindent">
And then again she carries round to all<br />

<p>And Euripides, in his Cretan Women, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">

</div>

<p>And then, when Leonidas the grammarian demanded a larger cup, and
said,&mdash;Let us drink hard (<ins title="Greek: kratêrizômen">κρατηρίζωμεν</ins>), my friends, (for that
was the word which Lysanias the Cyrenean says that Herodorus used to
apply to drinking-parties, when he says, "But when they had finished
the sacrifice they turned to the banquet, and to craters, and prayers,
and p&aelig;ans;" and the poet, who was the author of the poem called the
Buffoons&mdash;a play which Duris says that the wise Plato always had in his
hands&mdash;says, somewhere, <ins title="Greek: ekekratêrichêmes">ἐκεκρατηρίχημες</ins>, for "we had drunk;")
But now, in the name of the gods, said Pontianus, you are drinking in
a manner which is scarcely becoming, out of large cups, having that
most delightful and witty author Xenophon before your eyes, who in his
Banquet says,&mdash;"But Socrates, in his turn, said, But it seems to me
now, O men, that we ought to drink hard. For wine, in reality, while
it moistens the spirit, lulls the griefs to sleep as mandragora does
men; but it awakens all cheerful feelings, as oil does fire. And it
appears to me that the bodies of men are liable to the same influences
which affect the bodies of those things which grow in the ground; for
the very plants, when God gives them too much to drink, cannot hold up
their heads, nor can they expand at their proper seasons. But when they
drink just as much as is good for them, and no more, then they grow in
an upright attitude, and flourish, and come in a flourishing state to
produce fruit. And so, too, in our case, if we take too much drink all
at once, our bodies and our minds rapidly get disordered, and we cannot
even breathe correctly, much less speak. But if our slaves bedew us (to
use Gorgias-like language) in small quantities with small cups, then
we are not compelled to be intoxicated by the wine; but being gently
induced, we proceed to a merry and cheerful temperament."</p>

<p>112. Now, any one who considers these expressions of the accomplished
Xenophon, may understand how it was that the brilliant Plato displayed
such jealousy of him. But perhaps the fact may partly be because these
men did from the very

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 808]</span>

beginning feel a spirit of rivalry towards one
another, each being aware of his own powers; and perhaps they began
very early to contend for the preeminence, as we may conjecture not
only from what they have both written about Cyrus, but also from other
writings of theirs on similar subjects. For they have both written a
piece called the Banquet; and in these two pieces, one of them turns
out the female flute-players, and the other introduces them; and one,
as has been already said, refuses to drink out of large cups, but the
other represents Socrates as drinking out of a psycter till morning.
And in his treatise concerning the Soul, Plato, reckoning up all who
were present, does not make even the slightest mention of Xenophon.
And concerning Cyrus, the one says that from his earliest youth he was
trained up in all the national practices of his country; but Plato, as
if in the express spirit of contradiction, says, in the third book of
his Laws,&mdash;"But with respect to Cyrus, I consider that, as to other
things, he was indeed a skilful and careful general, but that he had
never had the very least particle of a proper education, and that he
had never turned his mind the least in the world to the administration
of affairs. But he appears from his earliest youth to have been engaged
in war, and to have given his children to his wives to bring up." And
again, Xenophon, who joined Cyrus with the Ten Thousand Greeks, in his
expedition into Persia, and who was thoroughly acquainted with the
treachery of Meno the Thessalian, and knew that he was the cause of the
murder of Clearchus by Tissaphernes, and who knew also the disposition
of the man, how morose and debauched he was,&mdash;has given us a full
account of everything concerning him. But the exquisite Plato, who all
but says, "All this is not true," goes through a long panegyric on him,
who was incessantly calumniating every one else. And in his Polity, he
banishes Homer from his city, and all poetry of the theatrical kind;
and yet he himself wrote dialogues in a theatrical style,&mdash;a manner of
writing of which he himself was not the inventor; for Alexamenus the
Teian had, before him, invented this style of dialogue, as Nicias of
Nic&aelig;a and Sotion both agree in relating. And Aristotle, in his treatise
on Poets, writes thus:&mdash;"Let us not then call those Mimes, as they
are called, of Sophron, which are written in metre, Discourses and
Imitations; or those Dialogues of Alexamenus
of Teos, which were written before the Socratic Dialogues;"&mdash;Aristotle,
the most learned of all men, stating here most expressly that
Alexamenus composed his Dialogues before Plato. And Plato also
calumniates Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, saying that he was a sophist in
a way consistent with his name.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> And he also attacks Hippias, and
Gorgias, and Parmenides; and in one dialogue, called Protagoras, he
attacks a great many;&mdash;a man who in his Republic has said, "When, as I
think, a city which has been governed by a democracy, feels a thirst
for liberty, and meets with bad cupbearers, and so it gets intoxicated
by too untempered a draught . . . ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 809]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PLATO.</div>

<p>113. And it is said also, that Gorgias himself, when he read the
dialogue to which Plato has given his name, said to his friends, "How
well Plato knows how to write iambics!" And Hermippus, in his book on
Gorgias, says,&mdash;"When Gorgias was sojourning at Athens, after he had
offered up at Delphi the golden image of himself which is there now,
and when Plato said when he had seen it, The beautiful and golden
Gorgias is come among us, Gorgias replied, This is indeed a fine young
Archilochus whom Athens has now brought forth." But others say that
Gorgias, having read the dialogue of Plato, said to the bystanders
that he had never said any of the things there attributed to him, and
had never heard any such things said by Plato. And they say that Ph&aelig;do
also said the same when he had read the treatise on the Soul, on which
account it was well said by Timon, respecting him,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
"How that learned Plato invented fictitious marvels!"
</div>

<p>For their respective ages will scarcely admit of the Socrates of Plato
ever having really had a conference with Parmenides, so as to have
addressed him and to have been addressed by him in such language. And
what is worst of all is, that he has said, though there was not the
slightest occasion for making any such assertion, that Zeno had been
beloved by Parmenides, who was his fellow-citizen. Nor, indeed, is
it possible that Ph&aelig;drus should have lived in the time of Socrates,
much less that he should have been beloved by him. Nor, again, is it
possible that Paralus and Xanthippus, the sons of Pericles, who died
of the plague, should have conversed with Protagoras when he came
the second time to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 810]</span>

Athens, as they had died before. And we might
mention many other particulars respecting his works to show how wholly
fictitious his Dialogues are.</p>

<p>114. But that Plato was ill-natured to everybody is plain from what
he says in his dialogue entitled Ion; in which first of all he
abuses all the poets, and then all those who have been promoted to
the highest dignities by the people, such as Phanosthenes of Andros,
and Apollodorus of Cyzicus, and also Heraclides of Clazomen&aelig;. And in
his Menon he abuses those who have been the greatest men among the
Athenians&mdash;Aristides and Themistocles; and he extols Meno, who betrayed
the Greeks. But in his Euthydemus he attacks this same Meno and his
brother Dionysiodorus, and calls them men slow to learn any good
thing, and contentious people, reproaching them with their flight from
Chios, which was their native place, from which they went and settled
in Thurii. And, in his essay on Manly Courage, he attacks Melesias,
the son of that Thucydides who headed the opposite party to Pericles,
and Lysimachus, the son of Aristides the Just, saying that they both
fell far short of their fathers' virtues. And as to what he said about
Alcibiades, in his Banquet, that is not fit to be produced to light;
nor is what he says in the first of the Dialogues which go by his
name. For the second Alcibiades is said by some people to be the work
of Xenophon; as also the Halcyon is said to be the work of Leon the
Academician, as Nicias of Nic&aelig;a says. Now, the things which he has said
against Alcibiades I will pass over; but I cannot forbear to mention
his calling the Athenian people a random judge, guided only by outward
appearance. And he praises the Laced&aelig;monians, and extols also the
Persians, who are the enemies of all the Greeks.</p>

<p>And he calls Cleinias the brother of Alcibiades a madman; and the sons
of Pericles he makes out to be fools; and Meidias he calls a man fit
for nothing but killing quails; and of the people of the Athenians he
says, that it wears a fair mask, but that one ought to strip the mask
off, and look at it then; for he says that it will then be seen that
it is only clothed with a specious appearance of a beauty which is not
genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 811]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PLATO.</div>

<p>115. But in the Cimon he does not abstain from accusing
Themistocles, and Alcibiades, and Myronides, and even Cimon himself;
and his Crito contains an invective against Sophocles; and his Gorgias
contains an invective not only against the man from whom it is named,
but also against Archelaus, king of Macedon, whom he reproaches not
only with his ignoble birth, but also with having killed his master.
And this is the very same Plato whom Speusippus represents as having,
while he professed to be a great friend of Archelaus, assisted Philip
to get possession of the kingdom. At all events, Carystius of Pergamus,
in his Historical Commentaries, writes as follows:&mdash;"Speusippus,
hearing that Philip used calumnious language respecting Plato, wrote
something of this sort in his letter to him: 'Just as if men did not
know that Philip originally obtained the kingdom by the assistance
of Plato.' For Plato sent Euphr&aelig;us of Oreum to Perdiccas, who
persuaded him to apportion a certain district to Philip; and so he,
maintaining a force in that country, when Perdiccas died, having all
his forces in a state of preparation, seized the supreme power." But
whether all this is true or not, God knows.</p>

<p>But his fine Protagoras, besides that it contains attacks on many poets
and wise men, also shows up the life of Callias with much greater
severity than Eupolis does in his Flatterers. And in his Menexenus, not
only is Hippias the Elean turned into ridicule, but also Antipho the
Rhamnusian, and Lamprus the musician. And the day would fail me, if I
were inclined to go through the names of all those who have been abused
by that wise man. Nor indeed do I praise Antisthenes; for he, having
abused many men, did not abstain even from Plato himself, but, having
given him the odious name of Sathon, he then published a dialogue under
this name.</p>

<p>116. But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, speaking
about the universal ill-nature of Plato towards everybody, writes
as follows:&mdash;"After the death of Socrates, when a great many of his
friends, being present at a banquet, were very much out of spirits,
Plato, being present, taking the cup, exhorted them not to despond,
as he himself was well able to lead the school; and, so saying, he
pledged Apollodorus: and he said, 'I would rather have taken the
cup of poison from Socrates than that pledge of wine from you.' For
Plato was considered to be an envious man, and to have a disposition
which was far from praiseworthy; for he ridiculed Aristippus when he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 812]</span>

went to visit Dionysius, though he himself had three times sailed to
Sicily,&mdash;once for the purpose of investigating the torrents of lava
which flow from Mount &AElig;tna, when he lived with the elder Dionysius,
and was in danger from his displeasure; and twice he went to visit the
younger Dionysius."</p>

<p>And again, though &AElig;schines was a poor man, and had but one pupil,
Xenocrates, he seduced him from him; and he was also detected in
instigating the commencement of a prosecution against Ph&aelig;do, which,
if successful, would have reduced him to slavery; and altogether he
displayed the feelings of a stepmother towards all the pupils of
Socrates. On which account, Socrates, making a not very unreasonable
conjecture respecting him, said in the presence of several persons
that he had had a dream, in which he thought he had seen the following
vision. "For I thought," said he, "that Plato had become a crow, and
leaped on my head, and began to scratch my bald place, and to take a
firm hold, and so to look about him. I think, therefore," said he,
"that you, O Plato, will say a good many things which are false about
my head." And Plato, besides his ill-nature, was very ambitious and
vainglorious; and he said, "My last tunic, my desire of glory, I lay
aside in death itself&mdash;in my will, and in my funeral procession, and
in my burial;" as Dioscorides relates in his Memorabilia. And as for
his desire of founding cities and making laws, who will not say that
these are very ambitious feelings? And this is plain from what he says
in the Tim&aelig;us&mdash;"I have the same feelings towards my constitution that a
painter would have towards his works; for as he would wish to see them
possessed of the power of motion and action, so too do I wish to see
the citizens whom I here describe."</p>

<p>117. But concerning the things which he has said in his Dialogues, what
can any one say? For the doctrine respecting the soul, which he makes
out to be immortal, even after it is separated from the body, and after
the dissolution of this latter, was first mentioned by Homer; for he
has said, that the soul of Patroclus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
<span class="linespace8">Fled to the shades below,</span><br />
Lamenting its untimely fate, and leaving<br />
Its vigour and its youth.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 813]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PLATO.</div>

<p>If, then, any one were to say that this is also the argument of
Plato, still I do not see what good we have got from him; for if any
one were to agree that the souls of those who are dead do migrate into
other natures, and do mount up to some higher and purer district, as
partaking of its lightness, still what should we get by that theory?
For, as we have neither any recollection of where we formerly were, nor
any perception whether we really existed at all, what do we get by such
an immortality as that?</p>

<p>And as to the book of the Laws composed by him, and the Polity which
was written before the Laws, what good have they done us? And yet
he ought (as Lycurgus did the Laced&aelig;monians, and as Solon did the
Athenians, and Zaleucus the Thurians), if they were excellent, to have
persuaded some of the Greeks to adopt them. For a law (as Aristotle
says) is a form of words decided on by the common agreement of a city,
pointing out how one ought to do everything. And how can we consider
Plato's conduct anything but ridiculous; since, when there were already
three Athenian lawgivers who had a great name,&mdash;Draco, and Plato
himself, and Solon,&mdash;the citizens abide by the laws of the other two,
but ridicule those of Plato? And the case of the Polity is the same.
Even if his Constitution is the best of all possible constitutions,
yet, if it does not persuade us to adopt it, what are we the better for
it? Plato, then, appears to have written his laws, not for men who have
any real existence, but rather for a set of men invented by himself; so
that one has to look for people who will use them. But it would have
been better for him to write such things as he could persuade men of;
and not to act like people who only pray, but rather like those who
seize hold of what offers itself to them.</p>

<p>118. However, to say no more on this point, if any one were to go
through his Tim&aelig;us and his Gorgias, and his other dialogues of the
same character, in which he discusses the different subjects of
education, and subjects of natural philosophy, and several other
circumstances,&mdash;even when considered in this light, he is not to be
admired on this account; for one may find these same topics handled
by others, either better than by him, or at all events not worse. For
Theopompus the Chian, in his book Against the School of Plato, says&mdash;
"We shall find the greater part of his Dialogues useless and false, and
a still greater number borrowed from other people; as some of them

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 814]</span>

come from the school of Aristippus, and some from that of Antisthenes,
and a great many from that of Bryson of Heraclea." And as to the
disquisitions which he enters into about man, we also seek in his
arguments for what we do not find. But what we do find are banquets,
and conversations about love, and other very unseemly harangues, which
he composed with great contempt for those who were to read them, as
the greater part of his pupils were of a tyrannical and calumnious
disposition.</p>

<p>119. For Euphr&aelig;us, when he was sojourning with king Perdiccas in
Macedonia, was not less a king than the other, being a man of a
depraved and calumnious disposition, who managed all the companionship
of the king in so cold a manner, that no one was allowed to partake
of his entertainments unless he knew something about geometry or
philosophy; on which account, after Philip obtained the government,
Parmenio, having caught him in Oreum, put him to death; as Carystius
relates in his Historical Commentaries. And Callippus the Athenian, who
was himself a pupil of Plato, having been a companion and fellow-pupil
of Dion, and having travelled with him to Syracuse, when he saw that
Dion was attempting to make himself master of the kingdom, slew him;
and afterwards, attempting to usurp the supreme power himself, was
slain too. And Euagon of Lampsacus (as Eurypylus says, and Dic&aelig;ocles
of Cnidus, in the ninety-first book of his Commentaries, and also
Demochares the orator, in his argument in defence of Sophocles, against
Philo), having lent his native city money on the security of its
Acropolis, and being afterwards unable to recover it, endeavoured to
seize on the tyranny, until the Lampsacenes attacked him, and repaid
him the money, and drove him out of the city. And Tim&aelig;us of Cyzicus
(as the same Demochares relates), having given largesses of money and
corn to his fellow-citizens, and being on this account believed by the
Cyzicenes to be an excellent man, after having waited a little time,
attempted to overturn the constitution with the assistance of Arid&aelig;us;
and being brought to trial and convicted, and branded with infamy, he
remained in the city to an extreme old age, being always, however,
considered dishonoured and infamous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 815]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote-left">PLATO.</div>

<p>And such now are some of the Academicians, who live in
a scandalous and infamous manner. For they, having by impious and
unnatural means acquired vast wealth by trickery, are at present highly
thought of; as Ch&aelig;ron of Pellene, who was not only a pupil of Plato,
but of Xenocrates also. And he too, having usurped the supreme power
in his country, and having exercised it with great severity, not only
banished the most virtuous men in the city, but also gave the property
of the masters to their slaves, and gave their wives also to them,
compelling them to receive them as their husbands; having got all these
admirable ideas from that excellent Polity and those illegal Laws of
Plato.</p>

<p>120. On which account Ephippus the comic poet, in his Shipwrecked Man,
has turned into ridicule Plato himself, and some of his acquaintances,
as being sycophants for money, showing that they used to dress in a
most costly manner, and that they paid more attention to the elegance
of their persons than even the most extravagant people among us. And he
speaks as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockindent">
Then some ingenious young man rising up,<br />
Some pupil of the New Academy,<br />
Brought up at Plato's feet and those of Bryso,<br />
That bold, contentious, covetous philosopher,&mdash;<br />
And urged by strong necessity, and able,<br />
By means of his small-wages-seeking art,<br />
To speak before th' assembly, in a manner<br />
Not altogether bad; having his hair<br />
Carefully trimm'd with a new-sharpen'd razor,<br />
And letting down his beard in graceful fall,<br />
Putting his well-shod foot in his neat slipper,<br />
Binding his ancles in the equal folds<br />
Of his well-fitting hose, and well protected<br />
Across the chest with the breastplate of his cloak,<br />
And leaning, in a posture dignified,<br />
Upon his staff; said, as it seems to me,<br />
With mouthing emphasis, the following speech,<br />
More like a stranger than a citizen,&mdash;<br />
"Men of the land of wise Athenians."
</div>

<p>And here let us put an end to this part of the discussion, my friend
Timocrates. And we will next proceed to speak of those who have been
notorious for their luxury.</p>

The Attic talent weighed within a fraction of fifty-seven
pounds, and the Babylonian talent was to the Attic as seven to six; but
Boeckh considers the Babylonian talent as equal to the &AElig;ginetan, which
was about eighty-two pounds and a quarter. The Attic mina was not quite
a pound; the &AElig;ginetan not quite one pound six ounces, being always
one-sixtieth part of a talent.</p></div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
